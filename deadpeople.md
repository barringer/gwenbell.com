###Mothering Ourselves

Holidays, but especially mother's day, used to majorly bum me. Lacking a living mom, I felt a fraud on mother's day. Excluded from some secret. This went on for years until I lived in Mexico and I watched funeral processions. I saw the slow motion moving caravans, the collective mourning. I saw that mourning doesn't have to be a solitary process.

When we mourn together, it's beautiful and it's not about exclusion.

I read Hope Edelman's _Motherless Daughters_ when I was still in high school. I felt very much the misfit then, my need for belonging chronically unmet. I realized post-divorce that I got married largely to meet my need for belonging. I didn't know then, but I know now, that belonging is a need, not a feeling. And that I'm capable of meeting all my own needs. No group will meet my need for belonging, no shoes will make me look like everybody else, and therefore more accepted. 

I first accept myself.

I'm noticing something now, for the first time in my life, as I walk to Manhattan from Brooklyn, I see no aggression in the faces I meet. I see sadness, or heartbreak at times, but never aggression.

Did I just project my own aggression onto their faces all these years?

It breaks my heart to think that might be true. And, I hold myself when I notice that sadness, the way the man at the Black Swan did the other night, when he ran in and headbutted Ev as he reached under his chair to catch the tiny baby bird who'd flown under him. He didn't even think, the bird-catcher, he just reached out with both hands and he cupped that baby in such a tender way, before releasing.

I saw in that what I do for myself now.

On this mother's day, if your mom is dying, as we all are, or if she's freshly dead, or if you've never met her at all. If you're looking around and aching today, this is me, running into a packed bar with my hands outstretched. You cannot be tender enough with yourself. 

_May you be held today._ 

May you know the person most qualified to do that holding is _you_.

###What to do with my ashes

Dear Everett,

Somehow stardust fell from the sky on one particular night and it made you you. And then, a few years later you met me, and we figured we came from the same star. Because there was the dust in your eye that matched mine.

You knew I was afraid to die. You knew I was careening towards thirty. And you knew I talked to faeries. 

I locked myself in the closet with them, is how you knew. “Faerie Laboratory (you read the sign out loud like a Brit), what are you doing to those faeries?!” to which I replied, “Nothing! I’m not like _cooking faeries_ in here. We’re communing!”

And still, you didn’t suggest meds, you just listened as I threw myself against walls and put on leg warmers and arm warmers and cried. And you watched as I put out thimblefulls of water for them. All this, and still you waited.

At some point, things began to shift. I heard what the faeries were saying and they were saying what I _did_ and then _put_ into _Digital Warriorship_.

So this is a final farewell of sorts. I’m thirty, and I was supposed to die at thirty, and I still could. So here’s what to do.

You already know. You have the eulogy written. I’d like to ask that should I be crushed by a bus and my life cut off here in the next little bit, I’d like to request that you take my ashes to that place on the edge of the country, where the ocean meets the forest and we had the two buck chuck out of a twist-top bottle and my yoga mat almost flew away. You take them there and if anyone wants to come, you can give them a bricked copy of _Digital Warriorship_ because I left it all on the field with that one, and I won’t be able to stick around and update the living document. 

Just let the doc live for one year after my untimely death.

And then, please release my ashes to the faeries. They’re there.

And to them I return.

But I’ll leave the star dust with you.

###Come Out Clean

I'm holding the certificate of my mom's death. It's rusty paper clipped together with the paperwork terminating my father's parental rights.

I didn't know my mom's social security number until I found this piece of paper. I don't think I ever even saw this until last night. I was going through paperwork, hand shredding old documents like the paperwork from the Red Cross, when they came after the house burned down. I've saved trauma paperwork I guess. Having it around helped me remember it was real.

Mom died November 30, 1992. My father's parental rights were terminated on the 7th of February 1994 due to item 10: the Defendant has not provided any support for the minor child since her birth. 

Looking at the time between those two dates, I might as well have lived twenty three lives.

Though the termination of his parental rights is final, the certificate of death is deeply final. It's even a slimmer volume than the termination of parental rights - that's three pages. Mom's death certificate is just one. At the bottom, someone named Gailia signed off on it. I guess Gailia had gotten a pay bump because she hand-scratched out Assistant so that just Deputy shows.

While I lived in my grandparent's basement teaching myself how to program I watched every episode of Six Feet Under. It was a treat when I was done coding for the day.

I'd tried to watch it years prior, but couldn't handle the intensity. The opening scenes, at the time I found simultaneously overwhelming and undertasteful. The sex scene in the airport closet? I was all, "who would actually do that?" And, that, I found out, was the point Alan Ball was making.

It was Six Feet Under that prompted my decision to move to New York City. I didn't have to travel anymore. Some things got cleared up in me. 

I saw humanity as sort of a giant human cake in the oven. Once in a while you open the oven door, you go in with a knife. You stick it in to check how it's doing, is it cooked all the way through? Every single time you pull out the knife, it doesn't come out clean. The cake never cooks all the way through.

I saw that in myself. I was able to see that there's no amount of striving, no amount of travel, no amount of work, no amount of doing that will make me stick the knife in and have it come out clean.

There is no clean.

I called Bub. 

Bub, I found mom's death certificate.

Well, honey, I wasn't aware it'd gone missing.

No, that's not what I mean. I mean I was going through some papers and it was in there somehow. I'd never seen it.

Mmhmm, well alright.

Well, I just learned her social security number.

Well, honey, I don't even think _I_ know her social security number.

<hr />

Then I called Nunu, later on.

We were out in the woods stripping out fish entrails.

That's hardcore. So listen, I just found mom's death certificate. Don't you reckon they have to recycle social security numbers? I just saw hers for the first time.

I suppose they do, don't they? I heard that one time, that they reuse them once the deceased has been gone twenty years.

Nunu, it's been that long now.

I know that is true.

<hr />

The cause of death is asked. There are all sorts of other questions, but under 'Due to or as a consequence of' there's Hodgkins Disease, which they don't know but I do, started as a lump in her neck. And next to that, approximate interval between onset and death: 5 years.

There is no question about how much money was in her bank account. There is no question about how much cash was in her wallet. There is no question about was her inbox at zero. There is no question about was there just this one last thing she wanted to get done real quick before we print this sucker out?

In death, we become one piece of paper, a single entry in the register of deeds. 

Our final selves, booked.
