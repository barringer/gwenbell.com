Dead People
===========

###Come Out Clean

I'm holding the certificate of my mom's death. It's rusty paper clipped together with the paperwork terminating my father's parental rights.

I didn't know my mom's social security number until I found this piece of paper. I don't think I ever even saw this until last night. I was going through paperwork, hand shredding old documents like the paperwork from the Red Cross, when they came after the house burned down. I've saved trauma paperwork I guess. Having it around helped me remember it was real.

Mom died November 30, 1992. My father's parental rights were terminated on the 7th of February 1994 due to item 10: the Defendant has not provided any support for the minor child since her birth. 

Looking at the time between those two dates, I might as well have lived twenty three lives.

Though the termination of his parental rights is final, the certificate of death is deeply final. It's even a slimmer volume than the termination of parental rights - that's three pages. Mom's death certificate is just one. At the bottom, someone named Gailia signed off on it. I guess Gailia had gotten a pay bump because she hand-scratched out Assistant so that just Deputy shows.

While I lived in my grandparent's basement teaching myself how to program I watched every episode of Six Feet Under. It was a treat when I was done coding for the day.

I'd tried to watch it years prior, but couldn't handle the intensity. The opening scenes, at the time I found simultaneously overwhelming and undertasteful. The sex scene in the airport closet? I was all, "who would actually do that?" And, that, I found out, was the point Alan Ball was making.

It was Six Feet Under that prompted my decision to move to New York City. I didn't have to travel anymore. Some things got cleared up in me. 

I saw humanity as sort of a giant human cake in the oven. Once in a while you open the oven door, you go in with a knife. You stick it in to check how it's doing, is it cooked all the way through? Every single time you pull out the knife, it doesn't come out clean. The cake never cooks all the way through.

I saw that in myself. I was able to see that there's no amount of striving, no amount of travel, no amount of work, no amount of doing that will make me stick the knife in and have it come out clean.

There is no clean.

I called Bub. 

Bub, I found mom's death certificate.

Well, honey, I wasn't aware it'd gone missing.

No, that's not what I mean. I mean I was going through some papers and it was in there somehow. I'd never seen it.

Mmhmm, well alright.

Well, I just learned her social security number.

Well, honey, I don't even think _I_ know her social security number.

<hr />

Then I called Nunu, later on.

We were out in the woods stripping out fish entrails.

That's hardcore. So listen, I just found mom's death certificate. Don't you reckon they have to recycle social security numbers? I just saw hers for the first time.

I suppose they do, don't they? I heard that one time, that they reuse them once the deceased has been gone twenty years.

Nunu, it's been that long now.

I know that is true.

<hr />

The cause of death is asked. There are all sorts of other questions, but under 'Due to or as a consequence of' there's Hodgkins Disease, which they don't know but I do, started as a lump in her neck. And next to that, approximate interval between onset and death: 5 years.

There is no question about how much money was in her bank account. There is no question about how much cash was in her wallet. There is no question about was her inbox at zero. There is no question about was there just this one last thing she wanted to get done real quick before we print this sucker out?

In death, we become one piece of paper, a single entry in the register of deeds. 

Our final selves, booked.

###Honest Shit from Real People

That holyfuckinshit moment when you find out your mom is dead. That moment never fades.

Maybe it will for you, but in twenty years, it has not for me.

I'm known to delete things. And I can't say I won't ever ragequit this section, but it seems right to me now. To tell you things about being a motherless daughter. Even though I am also a fatherless daughter, it was mom's absence - the impact of her death took years to absorb.

When I read honest shit from real people about hard things, I appreciate it. Not just appreciate - I grow from it, I learn from it, I take what I can from it - and I let the rest go. Take what you can from this, and let the rest go. 

I've met a lot of you through the years. Who? Motherless daughters. Like you, Canadian girl whose mom had just died and your grandma survived - from hitting a moose while driving one Canadian night. And then you went all over the world with that guy you weren't that into, you told me while he was in the shower. It was Canterbury, and I realized just how much I hated the Canterbury tales being there, but you were there. And I wanted to know: is it easier when it's sudden? And we agreed: there is no easier.

So if your mom died when you were a kid like me, or if she's dying now, which...we all are, or if you're having your first baby and becoming a mom, this is about moms and the daughters they have and the daughters they eventually leave.

I'll just tell you what I know in no particular order.

###The Way Out by Satya Khan

30 Apr 2013 Letter from [Satya Khan](http://systemlover.com) 

_Gwen,_

_Your post reminded me of one I wrote when my mom was dying in January. I'm sorry you lost her. It's awful._ 

_Satya_ 

_57: The Way Out_

_The fabric of her body is wearing thin. The doctors have many terms to describe her condition, but I hang on only one: hospice. We all want for her to go home._ 

_She's still there when I look into her eyes. I saw the impact in them when they said they're out of options. After that we got some lunch; my dad, my brother, and I. The soon to be survivors, feeling our way without her. I stared so hard into my bowl I saw the lettuce wilt._ 

_Back outside my mother's room, the chaplain crept up, asking if we follow a religion. My dad blew her off with a laugh, black and short. We have our own system, he said. A system lover, like me._

###Letter to my younger self (v2)

Hey g,

Lil g. G walla. I'm 31. You are not dead.

You being future you. Right now you're 21. You're about to go on some epic adventures, and you know it. I'm not here to talk about that. I'm here to talk about what you don't know. Well, you can guess. But you don't know for sure. So that's what this letter is about.

You are convinced you'll be dead by 30 like mom. But you won't be. You will try to speed things up a little in the end to see if you can kill yourself off, but killing yourself is hard and takes real effort. Effort that, once correctly applied, is actually more rewarding than self-destruction. (Pick up _The War of Art_. Life changer.)

There is that in you, that propensity to self-destruct. Then as now. 

It's ten years past your twenty-first year. That's crazy, huh?

You remember that time, I was thinking about it in the tub this morning, that you thought you'd lost Tench? You checked your bag, and you'd strapped him to the outside and you couldn't _believe_ you could be such an idiot. Then, you ran back to the checkpoint, and he was there, and he'd had quite the adventure while you were gone.

Now he and Iso are with a little family snuggled in some green green place in Japan. 

And you are in Brooklyn. And the jackhammers are going. And you never, ever thought you'd be here, like this, now. You never thought you'd get to this age, because you thought like her the cancer'd get ya and eat you a little at a time and give you bloody noses and slowly decimate you. And then you'd be dead.

But I'm here! Future you. So see? How could I both be sending you this message and be dead?

So here's the thing. You, like Brooklyn. You go hard. It's the momentum, the fire, the fuel, the little personal pocket rocket in you. 

You can keep going hard _and_ cut yourself some slack. Because if you're not dead at 30, that means you have a little extra time. To tease it out. To deepen into the posture. To push up against some new edges.

You'll get married. And then divorced. Hear me on this Gwen. If you are ambivalent about anything, listen to that. It's not a loud voice, but it is a voice. Trust ambivalence. Trust boredom, too. Just a feeling, it passes.

Slow down your decision making in those times. You can get your needs met in a whole lot of ways, and if you're feeling ambivalent about something, anything, a need is not yet met. Meet it before you put your name on _anything_.

And also, you can let yourself off the hook. You know you can do it all, on your own, without anybody's help.

But that's not all there is to it. You can also allow yourself to be held.

Not by somebody, but by something - you can rest (and rest and rest) in alaya. It's huge enough to hold you, too.

I promise you, and you know I don't do promises. 

I promise you this: you will be taken care of.

Future you,

g

###Letter to my younger self (v1)

This week I finished reading <em>What I Know Now</em>, a gorgeous book (it's more than a book, really...it's more of a stage for the women that share their stories) that showcases letters from women later in their lives to themselves as young women.  Women like Queen Noor and Vanna White share wisdom with their younger selves.  I found myself jotting notes and nodding in appreciation at the way these women have figured out how to mother themselves, whether or not they had a mom around to help.

It inspired me to write my own letter to my younger self (at age eleven when she died).  I didn't intend to share it with such a wide audience but think it may help someone.

_Gwendolyn_,

The nightmares will end soon enough.  You will make it through and nobody else will die for a while.  The recurring nightmare where ninjas come and silently kill everyone in your family...it will end in a few years and nobody else will die.  You will stop waking up unable to speak.

Right now you're pretty scared.  You think things will fall apart now that mom isn't around to keep them together.  You think you can hold them together but you're young...do the things that you love now.  Try to enjoy planting sunflowers with Mr. Allen's sixth grade class.  Be brave, but be gentle.

That's what's going to get you through, baby:  gentleness.  Court dates, meeting your father for the first time, watching your half siblings leave home, losing your step-father's side of the family, your grandparents becoming your caretakers.  All of these things you're dealing with right now, you're brave about.  I'm proud of you.  You're going to get through with flying colors.  You grow up all at once, but you can slow down, too.

You'll go on to graduate at the top of your class, you'll attend an amazing university and meet the first man in your life that will love you beyond what you thought possible.  He'll tell you (rightly) your mom is a "cross you bear" and play you an acoustic song he wrote to honor you and your mom.  Heart open, you'll go to therapy, meditate your way to a place of peace about her death.  You'll start exploring the wounds of your youth with tenderness...wonder if they'll ever heal.  They will.

You're going to travel, to see the world, to teach and start businesses abroad.  You'll do so much more by the time you're twenty-five than most people do in a lifetime.  You realize you can't take even one moment in a life for granted.

But will you remember to breathe, Gwen?  Can you, right now, holding this letter?  Breathe and relax.  Know that it's okay to cry and ask for help.  People will help you with their whole hearts if you let them.  I promise.

You're going to be independent.  You'll speak languages that few people in the world even know exist.  But for now, remember to have fun with yourself:  sing more, color more, dance more.  Don't expect anyone to understand completely; forgive them when they don't.

Above all, open to the grace within you.  Know that moving from your heart center you can accomplish anything.  And that accomplishing things isn't what it's about.  Loving is.  Love yourself, love others.  More than anything, allow yourself to be loved.

I love you,  <br />
You at twenty-six<br />
