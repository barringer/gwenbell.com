Dead People
===========

###Come Out Clean

I'm holding the certificate of my mom's death. It's rusty paper clipped together with the paperwork terminating my father's parental rights.

I didn't know my mom's social security number until I found this piece of paper. I don't think I ever even saw this until last night. I was going through paperwork, hand shredding old documents like the paperwork from the Red Cross, when they came after the house burned down. I've saved trauma paperwork I guess. Having it around helped me remember it was real.

Mom died November 30, 1992. My father's parental rights were terminated on the 7th of February 1994 due to item 10: the Defendant has not provided any support for the minor child since her birth. 

Looking at the time between those two dates, I might as well have lived twenty three lives.

Though the termination of his parental rights is final, the certificate of death is deeply final. It's even a slimmer volume than the termination of parental rights - that's three pages. Mom's death certificate is just one. At the bottom, someone named Gailia signed off on it. I guess Gailia had gotten a pay bump because she hand-scratched out Assistant so that just Deputy shows.

While I lived in my grandparent's basement teaching myself how to program I watched every episode of Six Feet Under. It was a treat when I was done coding for the day.

I'd tried to watch it years prior, but couldn't handle the intensity. The opening scenes, at the time I found simultaneously overwhelming and undertasteful. The sex scene in the airport closet? I was all, "who would actually do that?" And, that, I found out, was the point Alan Ball was making.

It was Six Feet Under that prompted my decision to move to New York City. I didn't have to travel anymore. Some things got cleared up in me. 

I saw humanity as sort of a giant human cake in the oven. Once in a while you open the oven door, you go in with a knife. You stick it in to check how it's doing, is it cooked all the way through? Every single time you pull out the knife, it doesn't come out clean. The cake never cooks all the way through.

I saw that in myself. I was able to see that there's no amount of striving, no amount of travel, no amount of work, no amount of doing that will make me stick the knife in and have it come out clean.

There is no clean.

I called Bub. 

Bub, I found mom's death certificate.

Well, honey, I wasn't aware it'd gone missing.

No, that's not what I mean. I mean I was going through some papers and it was in there somehow. I'd never seen it.

Mmhmm, well alright.

Well, I just learned her social security number.

Well, honey, I don't even think _I_ know her social security number.

Then I called Nunu, later on.

We were out in the woods stripping out fish entrails.

That's hardcore. So listen, I just found mom's death certificate. Don't you reckon they have to recycle social security numbers? I just saw hers for the first time.

I suppose they do, don't they? I heard that one time, that they reuse them once the deceased has been gone twenty years.

Nunu, it's been that long now.

I know that is true.

The cause of death is asked. There are all sorts of other questions, but under 'Due to or as a consequence of' there's Hodgkins Disease, which they don't know but I do, started as a lump in her neck. And next to that, approximate interval between onset and death: 5 years.

There is no question about how much money was in her bank account. There is no question about how much cash was in her wallet. There is no question about was her inbox at zero. There is no question about was there just this one last thing she wanted to get done real quick before we print this sucker out?

In death, we become one piece of paper, a single entry in the register of deeds. 

Our final selves, booked.
