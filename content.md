Brain Goop
==========

+ **26 Apr** Back in Black and Marathon Wire Weekend, biznitchez! You'll hear from me again on Monday.
+ **26 Apr** Hey, MF. You were totally right about The Wire. As of first 30 seconds of second episode, I am hooked.
+ **26 Apr** The more distributed/decentralized, the more resilient - your work, the web. The inverse is also true.
+ **25 Apr** Reading [The Great Donut](http://hastebin.evbogue.com/jifowufuke.md) by Seth Godin
+ **25 Apr** Going through archives of just the last 3 years. Jesus Christ. I have written. 
+ **25 Apr** New hastebin. [Notes on moving from addiction to freedom](http://hastebin.gwenbell.com/vujivaxata.md).
+ **24 Apr** Note to self: _well, it's basically the same as an aborted fetus. Probably not even conscious!_ Is not a way to encourage someone who just discovered the world's tiniest dead baby bird.
+ **23 Apr** I just watched the first episode of The Wire. Ambivalent, but wanting to like it.
