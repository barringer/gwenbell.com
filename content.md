  + 1 May • May. Yay! Went to Mr Kiwis and stocked up and then drank the most amazing kale, lemon, ginger, celery mix of all time. With paprika on top!
  + 30 Apr • Day two of your 30 days on the command line. In your copy of [Git Commit](http://git.gwenbell.com) now.
  + 29 Apr • Oh, snap! What's that sound? That's the sound of brand new bottom nav. Yes, yes y'all. Just don't click on writing. Yet.
  + 29 Apr • Here's a new route: [Motherless Daughters](http://gwenbell.com/motherlessdaughters). Just in time for mother's day, that day that if you don't have one might make you want to punch something in the face. Or, y'know. Cry.
  + 28 April • St Marks NYC. You know what? Hard coded routes, done. Nohuping out almost but not quite. Navigating to a destination with no phone in a city of millions, done. 2 out of 3 ain't bad.
  + 28 Apr • You know what's fracking exciting? Witnessing the plunge! [Madeleine Forbes](http://madeleineforbes.co.uk/) read Git Commit and published about it to her new site. Read her [response](http://gwenbell.com/responses).
  + 26 Apr • Hey, MF. You were totally right about The Wire. As of first 30 seconds of second episode, I am hooked.
  + 26 Apr • The more distributed/decentralized, the more resilient - your work, the web. The inverse is also true.
