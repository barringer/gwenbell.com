What I'm Working on and Why
---------------------------

I taught myself to code in 2004. I lived in Kiryu-shi, Japan, at the time. I was a full-time teacher at Yamamae Shōgakkō, and I loved the work. I also wanted to extend myself, to try something harder than teaching the Apples and Bananas song. I was frustrated with the limitations of LiveJournal, and wanted to create my own site, from scratch. So I taught myself to code.

I went to Kinokuniya and bought what looked like the friendliest code book - a visual quickstart guide, with an orange and lime green cover. Then I parked myself in front of the machine. Before that I announced I would spend the weekend with only the company of Ari and Yuutsu, the red eared sliders. I said I was becoming a coder and I when/if returned I'd be sweaty, gross and in a terrible mood.

Flash forward. I built this site from scratch. I know the whole stack - which means, from VPS (virtual private server) to the final output on your screen and all the switches that are thrown to create what you see. I'm familiar with every line in it. I'm empowered knowing that.

This time around, I had similar frustrations. Like LiveJournal, every CMS I tried - and I tried all the big ones - Squarespace, WordPress, Joomla - fell short. I want something as close to the bone as possible. So I created it. I call it [Bitters](https://github.com/gwenbell/bitters). 

This time around the door in wasn't CSS and HTML because I am competent at those. This time, the door was Git. I taught myself Git, Jade, Stylus and Node.js because I wanted to push myself, to learn something new, and to have a skill set few others possess. 

When I first got into the game, there were few women in my life who knew anything about code. Now, nearly ten years later, that same statement is (to my mind, sadly) true. In response, I stopped chatting. 

Instead of chatting - (my stance is women in tech: [commit](http://git.gwenbell.com)) - instead of wishing things were different, I drop myself deeper into the machine. I teach myself more skills and deliver them to you as a technical writer. 

As a technical writer, I dedicate my time, love, energy and life force to creating work that helps more people get themselves onto the command line. 

I believe, and I practice my beliefs, that if we aren't writing the code, it writes us. It's now program or be programmed. 

I choose _to shape_ what comes next, _not just_ consume it.
