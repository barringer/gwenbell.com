<p>Today I erased it all and started again. Deleted the whole caboodle, actually, thanks to Gwen Bell who somehow encouraged me to the very edge of the safe rubber dinghy that is blogging on a platform like Wordpress.</p>

<p>"I can't do it!" I said. "It's frightening! I'm a writer, a thinker, not some kind of tech-y code-y person who builds websites! All the Internet People will sense that and find out and judge me and be angry and throw bitcoins at me!"</p>

<p>Anyway, I scooched over to the edge of the rubber dinghy, and then I was like, "OK, this is nice. The water looks pretty good from here, especially because I know I don't have to be down with the cold and the seaweed and the sharks."</p>

<p>"How about I sit on the edge and just dangle my feet in the water of building my own website and still keep my Wordpress blog on the side. Besta both worlds, ya nada?"</p>

<p>But the water did look good, and it felt good too. There's something about wild swimming. You can't see the bottom, there are currents and rocks and you have to share the water with all kind of unknown critters. But if you've only ever swum in a pool filled with chlorine, policed by lifeguards with whistles, in goggles and a stretchy swimsuit, you haven't really swum. You've gotta dive into the freezing water stark naked and watch leaves floating by and get scared when you put your foot on something squishy. I'm starting to feel like it's a little bit the same with the internet.</p>

<p>I dunno, maybe I'm not as scared as I think I am most of the time. Or I have some kind of inner ninja who comes out when the real me's busy being neurotic somewhere else. Anyway I jumped. Deleted the whole damn thing with its admin passwords and meta tags and drafts and comments, all that fancy shizzle. I built this site on Twitter Bootstrap which is, where am I now with these metaphors, a life jacket? A float? Something.</p>

<p>"It's just you and me now, website" I said to my website on this sunny Cambridge afternoon, in the quiet of the library, watching the shadows from the history faculty lengthen towards the lawn.</p>

<p>You see, I'm going to learn to swim.</p>

Madeleine. Happy swimming. PS: I reckon if they start throwing bitcoins at you, you're doing it right! *chuckle* -g

I taught myself to code in 2004. I lived in Kiryu-shi, Japan, at the time. I was a full-time teacher at Yamamae Shōgakkō, and I loved the work. I also wanted to extend myself, to try something harder than teaching the Apples and Bananas song. I was frustrated with the limitations of LiveJournal, and wanted to create my own site, from scratch. So I taught myself to code.

I went to Kinokuniya and bought what looked like the friendliest code book - a visual quickstart guide, with an orange and lime green cover. Then I parked myself in front of the machine. Before that I announced I would spend the weekend with only the company of Ari and Yuutsu, the red eared sliders. I said I was becoming a coder and I when/if returned I'd be sweaty, gross and in a terrible mood.

Flash forward. I built this site from scratch. I know the whole stack - which means, from VPS (virtual private server) to the final output on your screen and all the switches that are thrown to create what you see. I'm familiar with every line in it. I'm empowered knowing that.

This time around, I had similar frustrations. Like LiveJournal, every CMS I tried - and I tried all the big ones - Squarespace, WordPress, Joomla - fell short. I want something as close to the bone as possible. So I created it. I call it [Bitters](https://github.com/gwenbell/bitters). 

This time around the door in wasn't CSS and HTML because I am competent at those. This time, the door was Git. I taught myself Git, Jade, Stylus and Node.js because I wanted to push myself, to learn something new, and to have a skill set few others possess. 

When I first got into the game, there were few women in my life who knew anything about code. Now, nearly ten years later, that same statement is (to my mind, sadly) true. In response, I stopped chatting. 

Instead of chatting - (my stance is women in tech: [commit](http://git.gwenbell.com)) - instead of wishing things were different, I drop myself deeper into the machine. I teach myself more skills and deliver them to you as a technical writer. 

As a technical writer, I dedicate my time, love, energy and life force to creating work that helps more people get themselves onto the command line. 

I believe, and I practice my beliefs, that if we aren't writing the code, it writes us. It's now program or be programmed. 

I choose _to shape_ what comes next, _not just_ consume it.
