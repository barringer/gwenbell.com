+ **24 Apr** Note to self: _well, it's basically the same as an aborted fetus. Probably not even conscious!_ Is not a way to encourage someone who just discovered a the world's tiniest dead baby bird.
+ **23 Apr** I just watched the first episode of The Wire. Ambivalent, but wanting to like it.
+ **23 Apr** News! Name change, cover update and three new pieces added. [Git Commit: Love on the Command Line](http://git.gwenbell.com). (Formerly Git for Publishers.) Now with more furry sex!
+ **23 Apr** Elsa Walsh on [the 'good enough life'](http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/why-women-should-embrace-a-good-enough-life/2013/04/18/4b2b086c-a5db-11e2-a8e2-5b98cb59187f_print.html) - hell yes.
+ **22 Apr** Hey, Kentaro. If you read this, please be in touch! I'm [gwen@gwenbell.com](mailto:gwen@gwenbell.com).
+ **22 Apr** Holy bajillion new happenings!
+ **20 Apr** It's Spring in New York City. It's gorgeous, clear-skied and flowering.
+ **19 Apr** Chills on chills. Wow, y'all.
+ **19 Apr** Letter out the door, inbox full of heart-felt responses in return. The best kind of push and pull. I am touched, again and again.
+ **19 Apr** Woke up to partly sunny skies and pull requests to merge. Thank you, Alex!!
+ **18 Apr** Know how you know when there's a new Drake album out? All of Bed-Stuy shakes to the new beats bumping from speakers at stoplights!
+ **18 Apr** Pulled [Bitters](https://github.com/gwenbell/gwenbell.com/pulse) down from Gitboria where it was hidden behind CJDNS. You can now view source. Pull request, anyone!?
+ **17 Apr** [Idiocracy](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/idiocracy/) may be my all-time favorite movie. Honest, hilarious, foreboding, robust. Just watched it for the third time. Confirmed. Might have killed Luke Wilson's career, but it lights me up.
+ **16 Apr** Discovered a new Japanese ramen ya, followed by work, followed by a conversation about SHA with M. This day could only get better with yoga. And that's next.
+ **16 Apr** [Shit](http://blog.linode.com/2013/04/16/security-incident-update/).
+ **15 Apr** Baked chocolate chip cookies, commited about 100 site changes, and added two new chapters to [Git for Publishers](http://git.gwenbell.com). Solid night in with candles lit and simply rain in the background.
+ **14 Apr** New [About](http://gwenbell.com/about). Hooray. Next, to yoga to decompress. Intense weekend on the machine!
