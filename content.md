Here are some of the reasons I use Git.

But first, let's let my bikemen in Tokyo say hi. They were magic, too. Far as I can tell, engineers are universally always in vogue. Talking about the levers and knowing how to work them are two different things.

##33 Reasons Git is Magic

1. I sleep at night because I use Git.
2. I never think about botnets because I use Git.
3. I don't worry about writing over a file and never being able to retrieve it, because I use Git.
4. I don't have to have a conversation about 'what do you think about this idea' - I just submit a pull request and let them take a look for themselves. If they don't like, they don't merge it.
5. I get to hang out in Linus Torvald's brain daily because I use Git.
6. I can work on a beach in Mexico because I use Git.
7. I learned the command line so I could use Git, and I'm grateful I did, because computers make a lot more sense to me now.
8. I can have an educated argument about rebasing now, because I learned Git.
9. My VPS, host and remotes can all go down, and I'll still have redundant copies of my site, because I learned Git.
10. I became a stronger developer by learning Git.
11. I contribute to other people's open source projects because I learned Git.
12. I never have to look at another CMS again if I don't want to, because I learned Git.
13. Anyone, anywhere, can contribute to my work by reading my code or writing and making a change with Git.
14. I can look at someone else's Git commits and know what it's like in their mind, because of Git.
15. I have become a more independent human now that I've learned Git.
16. I don't need to use any 'cloud-based' file systems because I use Git.
17. I keep learning new things in the programming realm, because Git unlocked some part of my mind.
18. I have a track record of everything I've done in my public digital world since I started using Git.
19. If I ragequit, there will still be a record. Which is great, because sometimes I ragequit.
20. My work is more resilient now that it's distributed.
21. I've learned to love servers now that I use Git.
22. I never have to think about data loss in FTP now that I use Git. Because I no longer use FTP.
23. I can help people devastated by the loss of their sites to botnets, now that I've learned Git.
24. I get to keep learning new things about Git, because Git is a genie's bottle of sorts.
25. I never have to pay for another paid site hosting service again, because I use Git. And Git's free.
26. The power of Voldemort. Like I wrote about in _Git Commit_.
27. I look at your commit record when you tell me you're a developer. And I know I'm looking at.
28. Submit a pull request. The four magic words of web development.
29. I know the entire stack of my site. That means from the base level of the server, to the top level of the design, I know the guts. Because I created them or set them up.
30. I learned Git and the basics of Linux simultaneously. That was cool.
31. I published [Git Commit](http://git.gwenbell.com) once I got far enough up the mountain I could pass back what I've learned. I published _Git Commit_ because I think it's cool enough you'll get something out of learning it, too.
32. Malware. It can't be injected into my site without me knowing about it. Like a charm, Git offers protection against evil doings.
33. I became an engineer when I started using Git.
