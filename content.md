  + 4 May • [New interview](http://gwenbell.com/about). On. Well, loads. All the things that make me squirm. Losing Twilight Imperium, and the path to becoming an engineer.
  + 3 May • Day so full I can't even remember how it started. Except, I do remember big hugs in the living room.
  + 2 May • Just added Day 4 on the command line to [Git Commit](http://git.gwenbell.com/) - what to do when you're overwhelmed in there. That, plus espresso. Mmyeah.
  + 1 May • May. Yay! Went to Mr Kiwis and stocked up and then drank the most amazing lemon, ginger, celery mix of all time. With paprika on top!
