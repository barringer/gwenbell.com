I'm Gwen Bell. I live at 81A Hart Street in Brooklyn, New York. I am a developer for <a href="http://bitters.gwenbell.com">Bitters</a>, I wrote <a href="http://git.gwenbell.com">Git Commit</a> a technical offering on the version control system. Intrigued? Listen in on the <a href="http://eepurl.com/Alaev">dev shop talk</a>. I think Git is magic and <a href="http://gittip.com/gwenbell">Gittip</a> is the future.
