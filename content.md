###New Writing

<p class="lead">New piece [on the _Terminal_](http://gwenbell.com/writing#death) writing process.</p> _Terminal_ enters the world on Tuesday, 28 May 2013, via the letter. See sidebar to become a reader if you're not already. 

###On Open Source

If we're a combination of the five people with whom we spend the most time, I am one part <a href="http://substack.net/">Substack</a>, one part <a href="http://tjholowaychuk.com/">TJ Holowaychuk</a>, one part <a href="http://evbogue.com/">Ev Bogue</a>, one part <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=rilke">Rilke</a> and one part <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=steve+jobs">Steve Jobs</a>.Those last two keep visiting from the astral plane.

You send messages. You ask: _How do I start programming? How do I become a web developer? How can I do what you do?_ 

You say: It's obvious from your Gittips [you're making some money](https://www.gittip.com/gwenbell/). It seems like it'll be good for me. But. How do I start?

The answer is you already have. Reading this, you're looking at words powered by code that I wrote. You're standing, right now, in an open source house called Bitters.

Open source means it's collaborative code. This site is built on Express, which TJ Holowaychuk first put into the world. And it's powered by Node.js, which Ryan Dhal first put into the world.

<h3>Mashups: We've seen this before</h3>

A decade ago photographers started using creative commons licenses. Some of these licenses say _take this photograph and do what you will with it_.

That's resulted in an uptick in creativity and sharing in the photography world.

I like remixing code. I enjoy cloning down repos to peek at what's going on under the hood. I get to see the inner workings of some of the minds with which I'm most aligned.

According to my [open source report card](http://osrc.dfm.io/gwenbell), that includes Substack, TJ Holowaychuk and Ev Bogue. I consider myself in good company.

In addition to tech and photography, we see this in the rap community. Girl Talk mashes up songs to make something entirely new. Still, the _core_ of each song he uses is in there. Girl Talk wouldn't exist without the performers who came before him.

He doesn't exist without his predecessors. 

We don't exist without each other. In no place is this more obvious than open source.

<h3>Response: It's too hard.</h3>

Those of you many years into your yoga practice, do you remember your first day on the mat? I remember my first yoga class, and I didn't even have a mat. It was hilarious. Hilarious because I had no idea what was going on, nor why I would continue to do it. Let alone how it would impact my life or the lives of those around me.

_It's too hard_ is an easy way to let yourself off the hook. And I'm not trying to get you on the hook, though if you're reading this there's probably a niggling feeling in you: she's right. I gotta go deeper. 

I've become a stronger writer because I've coupled it with programming. I've become a stronger web citizen because I started programming.

<h3>Next steps: How to start</h3>

As with yoga, you just start. It helps to have a good teacher. If that's not possible, it helps to have good books. I read things in a book first - it's how I learn.

When I started learning HTML and CSS in 2004, I opened a Visual Quickstart guide. It had lay-flat binding, which helped.

Though I was already a yoga practitioner, I didn't eat well during the time I was getting the basics down. I let myself eat junk food and skip showers.

Once you've gotten the basics, start cloning down repos. You don't have to do anything other than peer into them. I wrote about how to do this in [Git Commit](http://git.gwenbell.com).

<h3>Response: Why bother?</h3>

I'll tell you why I bother: I want to contribute to the web by creating _for_ it, not just _sucking from it_. I give back. Creating [Bitters](http://bitters.gwenbell.com) with Ev was a first step in contributing as a programmer. 

How'd I go about that? I built the container I wanted. It's a simple as possible Node.js website. It's the site you're looking at right now.

I get joy when I run across sites using an instance of Bitters. Like last night. I found [Demis Flanagan's](http://www.demisflanagan.linkpc.net/). Demis didn't ping me to let me know he'd cloned down and created a Bitters site, I just stumbled across it.

It was that moment, it was just. Yeah, Demis!

To know I might have shaved some hours off the time it would have taken him to get a Node site up. To know he can now spend those hours bobsledding if he wishes. To know I might have contributed in some small way to his work, to his life. That is why I bother.

How do we become more self-reliant citizens of the web? By committing. By contributing. 

We become self-reliant citizens of the web one line of code at a time.
