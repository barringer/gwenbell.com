Motherless Daughters
====================

That holyfuckinshit moment when you find out your mom is dead. That moment never fades.

Maybe it will for you, but in twenty years, it has not for me.

I'm writing this section because I know there are some of you out there who are, like me, not only motherless, but fatherless. You've gone your whole life feeling your way without a parent. Maybe, like me, you were also blessed with a pair of grandparents. A pair that, should either of them die, you will throw yourself into the grave with. I'm talking about that kind of love. I'm talking about that kind of ferocity.

I'm known to delete things. And I can't say I won't ever ragequit this section, but it seems right to me now. To tell you things about being a motherless daughter. Even though I am also a fatherless daughter, it was mom's absence - the impact of her death took years to absorb.

When I read honest shit from real people about hard things, I appreciate it. Not just appreciate - I grow from it, I learn from it, I take what I can from it - and I let the rest go. Take what you can from this, and let the rest go. 

I've met a lot of you through the years. Who? Motherless daughters. Like you, Canadian girl whose mom had just died and your grandma survived - from hitting a moose while driving one Canadian night. And then you went all over the world with that guy you weren't that into, you told me while he was in the shower. It was Canterbury, and I realized just how much I hated the Canterbury tales being there, but you were there. And I wanted to know: is it easier when it's sudden? And we agreed: there is no easier.

So if your mom died when you were a kid like me, or if she's dying now, which...we all are, or if you're having your first baby and becoming a mom, this is about moms and the daughters they have and the daughters they eventually leave.

I'll just tell you what I know in no particular order.

Letter to my younger self (v2)
------------------------------

Hey g,

Lil g. G walla. I'm 31. You are not dead.

You being future you. Right now you're 21. You're about to go on some epic adventures, and you know it. I'm not here to talk about that. I'm here to talk about what you don't know. Well, you can guess. But you don't know for sure. So that's what this letter is about.

You are convinced you'll be dead by 30 like mom. But you won't be. You will try to speed things up a little in the end to see if you can kill yourself off, but killing yourself is hard and takes real effort. Effort that, once correctly applied, is actually more rewarding than self-destruction. (Pick up _The War of Art_. Life changer.)

There is that in you, that propensity to self-destruct. Then as now. 

It's ten years past your twenty-first year. That's crazy, huh?

You remember that time, I was thinking about it in the tub this morning, that you thought you'd lost Tench? You checked your bag, and you'd strapped him to the outside and you couldn't _believe_ you could be such an idiot. Then, you ran back to the checkpoint, and he was there, and he'd had quite the adventure while you were gone.

Now he and Iso are with a little family snuggled in some green green place in Japan. 

And you are in Brooklyn. And the jackhammers are going. And you never, ever thought you'd be here, like this, now. You never thought you'd get to this age, because you thought like her the cancer'd get ya and eat you a little at a time and give you bloody noses and slowly decimate you. And then you'd be dead.

But I'm here! Future you. So see? How could I both be sending you this message and be dead?

So here's the thing. You, like Brooklyn. You go hard. It's the momentum, the fire, the fuel, the little personal pocket rocket in you. 

You can keep going hard _and_ cut yourself some slack. Because if you're not dead at 30, that means you have a little extra time. To tease it out. To deepen into the posture. To push up against some new edges.

You'll get married. And then divorced. Hear me on this Gwen. If you are ambivalent about anything, listen to that. It's not a loud voice, but it is a voice. Trust ambivalence. Trust boredom, too. Just a feeling, it passes.

Slow down your decision making in those times. You can get your needs met in a whole lot of ways, and if you're feeling ambivalent about something, anything, a need is not yet met. Meet it before you put your name on _anything_.

And also, you can let yourself off the hook. You know you can do it all, on your own, without anybody's help.

But that's not all there is to it. You can also allow yourself to be held.

Not by somebody, but by something - you can rest (and rest and rest) in alaya. It's huge enough to hold you, too.

I promise you, and you know I don't do promises. 

I promise you this: you will be taken care of.

Future you,

g
