Motherless Daughters
====================

That holyfuckinshit moment when you find out your mom is dead. That moment never fades.

Maybe it will for you, but in twenty years, it has not for me.

I'm writing this section because I know there are some of you out there who are, like me, not only motherless, but fatherless. You've gone your whole life feeling your way without a parent. Maybe, like me, you were also blessed with a pair of grandparents. A pair that, should either of them die, you will throw yourself into the grave with. I'm talking about that kind of love. I'm talking about that kind of ferocity.

I'm known to delete things. And I can't say I won't ever ragequit this section, but it seems right to me now. To tell you things about being a motherless daughter. Even though I am also a fatherless daughter, it was mom's absence - the impact of her death took years to absorb.

When I read honest shit from real people about hard things, I appreciate it. Not just appreciate - I grow from it, I learn from it, I take what I can from it - and I let the rest go. Take what you can from this, and let the rest go. 

I've met a lot of you through the years. Who? Motherless daughters. Like you, Canadian girl whose mom had just died and your grandma survived - from hitting a moose while driving one Canadian night. And then you went all over the world with that guy you weren't that into, you told me while he was in the shower. It was Canterbury, and I realized just how much I hated the Canterbury tales being there, but you were there. And I wanted to know: is it easier when it's sudden? And we agreed: there is no easier.

So if your mom died when you were a kid like me, or if she's dying now, which...we all are, or if you're having your first baby and becoming a mom, this is about moms and the daughters they have and the daughters they eventually leave.

I'll just tell you what I know in no particular order.

Letter to my younger self (v2)
------------------------------

Hey g,

Lil g. G walla. I'm 31. You are not dead.

You being future you. Right now you're 21. You're about to go on some epic adventures, and you know it. I'm not here to talk about that. I'm here to talk about what you don't know. Well, you can guess. But you don't know for sure. So that's what this letter is about.

You are convinced you'll be dead by 30 like mom. But you won't be. You will try to speed things up a little in the end to see if you can kill yourself off, but killing yourself is hard and takes real effort. Effort that, once correctly applied, is actually more rewarding than self-destruction. (Pick up _The War of Art_. Life changer.)

There is that in you, that propensity to self-destruct. Then as now. 

It's ten years past your twenty-first year. That's crazy, huh?

You remember that time, I was thinking about it in the tub this morning, that you thought you'd lost Tench? You checked your bag, and you'd strapped him to the outside and you couldn't _believe_ you could be such an idiot. Then, you ran back to the checkpoint, and he was there, and he'd had quite the adventure while you were gone.

Now he and Iso are with a little family snuggled in some green green place in Japan. 

And you are in Brooklyn. And the jackhammers are going. And you never, ever thought you'd be here, like this, now. You never thought you'd get to this age, because you thought like her the cancer'd get ya and eat you a little at a time and give you bloody noses and slowly decimate you. And then you'd be dead.

But I'm here! Future you. So see? How could I both be sending you this message and be dead?

So here's the thing. You, like Brooklyn. You go hard. It's the momentum, the fire, the fuel, the little personal pocket rocket in you. 

You can keep going hard _and_ cut yourself some slack. Because if you're not dead at 30, that means you have a little extra time. To tease it out. To deepen into the posture. To push up against some new edges.

You'll get married. And then divorced. Hear me on this Gwen. If you are ambivalent about anything, listen to that. It's not a loud voice, but it is a voice. Trust ambivalence. Trust boredom, too. Just a feeling, it passes.

Slow down your decision making in those times. You can get your needs met in a whole lot of ways, and if you're feeling ambivalent about something, anything, a need is not yet met. Meet it before you put your name on _anything_.

And also, you can let yourself off the hook. You know you can do it all, on your own, without anybody's help.

But that's not all there is to it. You can also allow yourself to be held.

Not by somebody, but by something - you can rest (and rest and rest) in alaya. It's huge enough to hold you, too.

I promise you, and you know I don't do promises. 

I promise you this: you will be taken care of.

Future you,

g

Letter to my younger self (v1)
------------------------------

This week I finished reading <em>What I Know Now</em>, a gorgeous book (it's more than a book, really...it's more of a stage for the women that share their stories) that showcases letters from women later in their lives to themselves as young women.  Women like Queen Noor and Vanna White share wisdom with their younger selves.  I found myself jotting notes and nodding in appreciation at the way these women have figured out how to mother themselves, whether or not they had a mom around to help.

As I read, I felt surrounded by kindred spirits.  I felt acutely aware of the fact that I was in good company.  That trusting my gut and working from there was the only way to engage this world.

Marilyn Carlson Nelson wraps up her letter to herself saying, "So you see, Marilyn, in the end you weren't really dreaming about titles or positions or even about being a wife or a mother.  Rather, you were dreaming about living the life that would complete you-- one of purpose and passion and always with the intention to make a difference."  

That paragraph resonated deeply with me...deep enough to inspire me to write my own letter to my younger self (at age eleven when she died).  I didn't intend to share it with such a wide audience but think it may help someone out there who has struggled or is struggling with some of these life elements.


_Gwendolyn_,

The nightmares will end soon enough.  You will make it through and nobody else will die for a while.  The recurring nightmare where ninjas come and silently kill everyone in your family...it will end in a few years and nobody else will die.  You will stop waking up unable to speak.

Right now you're pretty scared.  You think things will fall apart now that mom isn't around to keep them together.  You think you can hold them together but you're young...do the things that you love now.  Try to enjoy planting sunflowers with Mr. Allen's sixth grade class.  Be brave, but be gentle.

That's what's going to get you through, baby:  gentleness.  Court dates, meeting your father for the first time, watching your half siblings leave home, losing your step-father's side of the family, your grandparents becoming your caretakers.  All of these things you're dealing with right now, you're brave about.  I'm proud of you.  You're going to get through with flying colors.  You grow up all at once, but you can slow down, too.

You'll go on to graduate at the top of your class, you'll attend an amazing university and meet the first man in your life that will love you beyond what you thought possible.  He'll tell you (rightly) your mom is a "cross you bear" and play you an acoustic song he wrote to honor you and your mom.  Heart open, you'll go to therapy, meditate your way to a place of peace about her death.  You'll start exploring the wounds of your youth with tenderness...wonder if they'll ever heal.  They will.

You're going to travel, to see the world, to teach and start businesses abroad.  You'll do so much more by the time you're twenty-five than most people do in a lifetime.  You realize you can't take even one moment in a life for granted.

But will you remember to breathe, Gwen?  Can you, right now, holding this letter?  Breathe and relax.  Know that it's okay to cry and ask for help.  People will help you with their whole hearts if you let them.  I promise.

You're going to be independent.  You'll speak languages that few people in the world even know exist.  But for now, remember to have fun with yourself:  sing more, color more, dance more.  Don't expect anyone to understand completely; forgive them when they don't.

Above all, open to the grace within you.  Know that moving from your heart center you can accomplish anything.  And that accomplishing things isn't what it's about.  Loving is.  Love yourself, love others.  More than anything, allow yourself to be loved.

I love you,  <br />
You at twenty-six<br />
