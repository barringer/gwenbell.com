Motherless Daughters
--------------------

That holyfuckinshit moment when you find out your mom is dead. That moment never fades.

Maybe it will for you, but in twenty years, it has not for me.

I'm writing this section because I know there are some of you out there who are, like me, not only motherless, but fatherless. You've gone your whole life feeling your way without a parent. Maybe, like me, you were also blessed with a pair of grandparents. A pair that, should either of them die, you will throw yourself into the grave with. I'm talking about that kind of love. I'm talking about that kind of ferocity.

I'm known to delete things. And I can't say I won't ever ragequit this section, but it seems right to me now. To tell you things about being a motherless daughter. Even though I am also a fatherless daughter, it was mom's absence - the impact of her death took years to absorb.

When I read honest shit from real people about hard things, I appreciate it. Not just appreciate - I grow from it, I learn from it, I take what I can from it - and I let the rest go. Take what you can from this, and let the rest go. 

I've met a lot of you through the years. Who? Motherless daughters. Like you, Canadian girl whose mom had just died and your grandma survived - from hitting a moose while driving one Canadian night. And then you went all over the world with that guy you weren't that into, you told me while he was in the shower. It was Canterbury, and I realized just how much I hated the Canterbury tales being there, but you were there. And I wanted to know: is it easier when it's sudden? And we agreed: there is no easier.

So if your mom died when you were a kid like me, or if she's dying now, which...we all are, or if you're having your first baby and becoming a mom, this is about moms and the daughters they have and the daughters they eventually leave.

I'll just tell you what I know in no particular order.
