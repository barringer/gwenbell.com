<blockquote>More than anything, you've inspired me to continue to challenge my attachments and "the way things are done" – both personally and professionally. - Kathleen Shannon, <a href="http://braidcreative.com">Braid Creative</a></blockquote>

My name is Gwen Bell. I live in Brooklyn, New York. I was born in July 1981, in Jacksonville Florida to a beautiful, unwed mother. Bell is my maternal line; no father is listed on my birth certificate. Pictured: Bub, my mom's dad. His mom, Nana. Mom, and me at one.

I moved to New York City in March 2013. There is nowhere else I'd rather be. I know. Because I checked.

Before New York I spent 2012 traveling the globe (Berlin, London, Singapore, Japan, and Mexico). As I traveled, I looked for what's next in tech. I didn't find it out there, so I decided to program it myself.

I [write](http://git.gwenbell.com) and [program](/git) for a living. I write to [inboxes](https://tinyletter.com/gwenbell) and this site. I earn from the products I create, and from what I think of as [micro-genius grants](http://gittip.com/gwenbell).

<h3>What I've done so far</h3>

**An unresume. I wrote this on 16 May 2013 while drinking sangria, made by an authentic Spaniard.**

<mark>I do something as long as it's a challenge. Once I've mastered it, I walk away. Like walking away from an empty husk.</mark>

**2003** In May 2003, I graduated from UNC-Chapel Hill with a major in English Lit and a minor in Women's Studies. Bill Cosby spoke at graduation. He made the parents and grandparents stand up. The graduates clapped for them, because, Bill Cosby said, they were the reason we were graduating. He was right - <mark>my grandparents, Nunu and Bub, were and are my biggest champions</mark>. They took me in after my mom died, and then they raised me as their own child.

Following graduation, I had big plans to take on the world. I'd just spent a year studying abroad in England and a summer and winter in Morocco, and I wanted to travel some more. So, I did.

Before I flew out, <mark>I started a LiveJournal account. That's how I became a digital publisher</mark>. I just started writing for Nunu, so she could track my progress (or stories or horror stories) abroad.

**2003** I flew to Japan with a company called NOVA. I tried to get upgraded to first class by wearing a suit. Denied.

NOVA eventually went bankrupt, but before it did I taught as an English teacher in the heart of Tokyo, in Kokubunji. I wore a suit every day and I hated the suit but I loved the teaching. I saw an ad for a pilot program. NOVA needed teachers in elementary schools. I applied. I was one of only four to get the position. <mark>To start my career, I taught English to Japanese children for one year</mark>.

**2004** In 2004 I started teaching yoga. I taught it at Paper Tiger, a donation-based studio I started above an izakaya in downtown Kiryu. My first students were the Japanese teachers from Yamamae. I was ready for the next challenge, and I taught myself CSS and HTML to prepare for it.

**2005** In 2005, at the completion of a year teaching in the elementary school, I cranked it to the next level. <mark>I rolled all my teaching money into the key money and deposit on a yoga studio in Yokohama, Japan</mark>. Besides the studio, Patrick and I also co-podcasted Zen is Stupid for three and a half years.

**2006-2007** I co-ran Yoga Garden until 2007, when I became a freelance designer with a company called Zaadz. Zaadz was later acquired by Gaiam, and before that I did design work, and then traveled all over the States meeting my co-workers I only knew from the internet. Then, I co-founded Buddhist Geeks.

**2007-2009** In 2007 my house burned down, and with it the design firm that was located in the front of the house. The Red Cross helped out a ton. While I was living on couches, <mark>I taught yoga during the first Startup Weekend</mark>, which is where I got the idea I might want to work in the startup world.

I took a photo of one of the MacBooks that didn't make it out. That photo went kind of viral in the tech world. Lots of people thought it was not a laptop at all, but a s'more. They saved everything off the hard drive.

Around this time, I went to BlogHer for the first time. I decided the next year I wanted to speak at the conference. I also live-tweeted it. That was early days for Twitter, and nobody was live-tweeting. I just thought it would be a crazy idea, so I did.

I spoke at BlogHer the very next year, 2008. I spoke about syndicating your content. <mark>During this time I was a brand ambassador for Nintendo.</mark> I played games and wrote about them sometimes. Sweet gig, as you might imagine.

**2009-2010** In 2009 I married a handsome programmer. We are now divorced, and at the time I learned a lot from him about programming. He worked for a startup that was acquired. While on our post-wedding vacation, I got an invite to Social Web Foo Camp, which I accepted. During that time I did commercial for HP, launched Best 09 (which grew to 730 participants in a few weeks).

**2010-2012** From 2010 to 2013 I earned my living as a writer, consultant and speaker. I signed with a speaking agent, spoke at engagements all over the country, taught social web classes at the University of Colorado at Boulder, <mark>and was featured on the cover of a magazine for their 'Discover Something Wonderful' edition</mark>.

The magazine is Experience Life, and I later did consulting with them and can't say enough good things about that team. I ran Reverb 10 with two fine people, from November 30 to December 30 2010. Three thousand people participated.

<blockquote>What sets [Gwen Bell] apart from the slew of young, hip pro-Facebookers out there is that she not only translates the complicated language of social media, she also teaches technologists to unplug. - Sheryl Sulistiawan, Fast Company</blockquote>

**2012-2013** From 2012 to 2013 I unplugged to travel the globe. I sold my iPhone in the Mission and continue to live without a phone. I earned, and earn, my living by writing to the inboxes of [thousands of you](/responses)* located in places all over the globe. I made a living [as a writer](/thework). 

**2013** I wanted to know what was next in tech. I flew all over the globe to find out. While I did that, I powered down my social accounts to travel and be _in_ it rather than _reporting about it_. I didn't find what's next in tech. Since I didn't find it, I decided I'd have to create it. I became a programmer. <mark>I taught myself Git, Node.js, JavaScript, Linux, Unix, the command line.</mark> I won a game (after badly losing the first time) of Twilight Imperium to kick it all off. 

And now. I write, I program and, when it's available, I drink sangria with my housemates in Bed-Stuy, Brooklyn, New York.

<h3>Yoga </h3>

I got my first laptop the same year I started practicing yoga. I taught myself HTML and CSS so I could make the site for my yoga studio in Japan. I see my time on the mat informing my time on the machine, a tiny infinity. The work I do on the mat shows up on the command line. I wrote the practices that inform my work into [Digital Warriorship](/thework).
