About
=====

I'll guess you came to my about page for the same reason I might go to yours. To see what we have in common.

Well, I didn't drink all the Zimas in this picture. I don't even know whose house I was in at the time, nor whose couch I crashed on. It was definitely Scotland. And I remember hanging out with Pete, who was from some London suburb or other. Lincoln? Anyway. As I rode off on the train he flipped me the bird and mooned me. Great guy, that Pete. Real charmer.

When I was a baby, my grandparents came to Florida and picked me and Mom up. She was a teenage mom which I guess is trendy now but most decidedly was not in the 80s, and she had me in kind of a precarious, shitty situation. I don't have all the details because I was all prenatal and whatnot, but I gather it was a deadbeat dad kind of deal. 

Nunu is not pictured here, but Bub is, and so's Nana, his mom, and so am I as a baby, and so is my mom, the woman holding me - she got married one year and a day after my birth, hence the ring. After mom died when I was a kid and she was not much more of a woman than she is pictured here, I lived with my grandparents full time and they raised me as their own. 

Nunu and Bub's love runs through all my work, every offering I've ever made and anything good whatsoever I've contributed to the world.

##But really. What have you been up to since graduation?

**So you graduated from Carolina?**

Yes. Mmhmm. With a degree that guaranteed me nothing. It was already 'the recession'.

**So you went to Japan?**

Right. [Patrick](mailto:sendpatrickemail@gmail.com) had just gotten back from Morocco where he'd been stationed in the Peace Corps. I'd spent a summer and winter there with him in the High Atlas Mountains. I figured after that, what could be more challenging?

**You didn't speak Japanese?**

Nope. I bought _Hiragana Ganbatte_ and taught myself Hiragana. And that was it.

**And then what?**

And then I worked for a company called Nova which went bankrupt, but even now when I meet someone in the Japaneast Village and say Nova they put their fingers to their head and go 'usagi' and I'm all, ha! Yeah. That's the one.

**Ok, so then what.**

So then they had an experimental program, Nova did. Where they wanted to send a few pilot peeps into the Japanese elementary school system to teach elementary school kids English. I got the position and became an English teacher at Yamamae Shogakko.

**Alright. Then what?**

Then, at the end of that year, I started teaching yoga. I liked using the body to teach, so it was a natural extension. During that time, I taught myself to code. I learned HTML and CSS, so that when it was time to open the yoga studio, I had the skills to build a site.

**So you started a yoga studio in Japan?**

Right. That was my first business.

**How was that?**

Hard. As all things worth doing are. We ran the studio for seven years. It was a hit, and by the time we closed, yoga was less a thing in Japan and running was what people were doing. Patrick expanded his business to the web, and I moved back to the States and started a design firm.

**That's the one that burned down?**

Right. In 2007. Here's a photo of the MacBook that made it out. I took the pic the morning after the fire. I was staying in a motel provided by the Red Cross. This laptop belonged to the girl who left the candle burning.

True story: they got the hard drive off it, no data loss. 

Unreal, right? I was homeless for a bit. I tried living in a tent. Yeah, not my style.

**So then what?**

So then I started doing things for Startup Weekend. I was sleeping on a couch, but I went to the first Startup Weekend which in short is a weekend of geekery where we built things and deployed them in a sleep-deprived stretch of 72 hours. I taught laptop yoga every hour, on the hour. Eventually I became a liason between the programmers and the front-end folk. I helped make them happen in Chapel Hill, Houston, Boston.

**And then?**

And then, somewhere in there I met a programmer and from 2009 to 2011 we were married.

**That was brief.**

Felt long to me.

**You were kind of semi-internet famous back then, right?**

That's what people tell me. I think it was the cover of the magazine. 

I shared shelf space with Oprah. Big moment. Made the grandparents proud. I link it to the fact I'd gotten into Tw/tt/r early on. And I was fraking good at it. I did the speaking circuit thing and the consulting thing and made a bundle and gave myself Bells Palsy from the stress. That was 2009-2011.

**Ok, so then what?**

So then, I divorced the programmer. As I recovered I flew around the globe living out of one bag trying to determine what's next in tech. I published to several thousand inboxes on a daily basis, and people bought the work. Which is how I continued traveling.

**Did you find out what's next in tech?**

Well, yes and no. I found it in the sense that I realized it was not going to come from out there, it was going to come from in here. 

The future I want on the web is the one I will engineer.

**Damn, alright. So what did you do?**

I flew back to the States and met a sage on the streets of Boulder, Colorado. I think he is the only true practitioner of anything worth learning in all the time I was in Boulder. His name is Eric. He lives in his van. You'll find him in front of Trident smoking rollies. 

Eric got my frustration with my MacBook Air and he pushed me to put Linux on it. Which I did. Besides Eric, I have no reason to recommend Boulder anymore. To say that breaks my heart is an understatement. I think the Miracle-Gro that is venture capital did a number on the place. The roots are shot. 

Whole nother story, ask me in person.

**Anyway...**

Anyway, after losing a game of Twilight Imperium very, very badly - like, I punched myself in the face badly...this was after the world tour and I was flat ass broke again. After losing I held very still. I contemplated the cosmos. If you've never played Twilight Imperium, it's impossible to help you understand it. I won't try, but TI3 was the first strategy board game I'd ever played. I never played Risk or Axis and Allies. I was in no way prepared for the experience. I'm not sure you can be.

**You punched yourself in the face.**

It was an accident, and I was crying so hard, and losing so terribly that yes, I punched myself in the face with my  water bottle.

**Ok, I'm laughing. How can this end well?**

It didn't. So the next thing that happened was I held very still, contemplated all of space and time, read some Alan Watts and realized _the game_ is not what matters. I can't hold all perspectives on the board while minding my own business. 

I saw I have to focus on just my slice of the pie. I strategized. I rtfm'd. I played Twilight Imperium for the second time.

**And what?**

And I brought my yoga mat. And I ate food. And I practiced when it was break time, and I drank a ton of water. I took notes like 'take mecatol rex, two points'.

**And? And?**

And I WON. It was a sixteen hour game. And I not only didn't lose my shit even once, I won in such an epic way that the guy whose place I was crashing at kicked me out the next day. 

Into the snow, into the winter. 

**Damn. Hardcore.**

You have no idea. I think it was a sonuvabitch move but yo. I learned a lot. And also. Twilight Imperium? That's kind of how I became a programmer. I started to see systems. In some ways I wonder if aliens brought TI3 to us from another realm.

**Surely there is more to this story you're telling me.**

You know, you're probably right. Right now, the biggest thing is the distributed web. For me, that's meant learning and now [teaching Git](http://git.gwenbell.com). And, [building Bitters](http://bitters.gwenbell.com). 

I love this work. I love this city. 

I had to go through the shitter to get here, but maybe that's the point of being human.

<hr />

##What is this site?

I hand-built this site from scratch. It's an instance of [Bitters](http://bitters.gwenbell.com). It's Node.js, markdown, Jade and Stylus. I host it on a VPS and commit it to [Git](http://github.com/gwenbell).
		
I try to balance responding to messages with creating new work on the command line and in my writing. Sometimes a message turns into fodder for the work, which I always appreciate.

##How can I get in touch?

If you send me your life story and I have a dozen items plus to do that day, I might skim it. If you want to book me for consulting or speaking or anything weird please give me the wh's [gwen@ gwenbell.com](mailto:gwen@gwenbell.com). If you don't expect a response, please write NRN in closing. If you have a specific request, I ask that you front-load it, rather than burying it or tucking it in a postscript. Please don't send praise - instead, tell the lady in front of you in the checkout line how that color blue in her top really brings out her eyes.

##Who else engages in this work?

A writer isn't a writer without readers. All kinds of people all over the world engage with my work. Sometimes I meet them in person! And I'm always touched and blown away at the way my work in the world impacts theirs. Some of them share [their stories here](http://gwenbell.com/responses).

##How can I contribute?

I am an engineer. I am in the machine every day. One thing that means is I run this site on the command line. If you see an error, as you likely will, please [submit a pull request](https://github.com/gwenbell). If you can't submit a pull request, hmm. Ok. You have to start somewhere. You can start by <a href="http://git.gwenbell.com">learning Git</a>.

I took this picture in Chuckanut Forest in Washington State. That's where I've asked Ev to spread my ashes. There are faeries there. You must hold very still and look very close to see them.
