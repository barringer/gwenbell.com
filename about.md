About
=====

I'll guess you came to my about page for the same reason I might go to yours. To see what we have in common.

Well, I didn't drink all the Zimas in this picture. I don't even know whose house I was in at the time, nor whose couch I crashed on. It was definitely Scotland. And I remember hanging out with Pete, who was from some London suburb or other. Lincoln? Anyway. As I rode off on the train he flipped me the bird and mooned me. Great guy, that Pete. Real charmer.

When I was a baby, my grandparents came to Florida and picked me and Mom up. She was a teenage mom which I guess is trendy now but most decidedly was not in the 80s, and she had me in kind of a precarious, shitty situation. I don't have all the details because I was all prenatal and whatnot, but I gather it was a deadbeat dad kind of deal. 

Nunu is not pictured here, but Bub is, and so's Nana, his mom, and so am I as a baby, and so is my mom, the woman holding me - she got married one year and a day after my birth, hence the ring. After mom died when I was a kid and she was not much more of a woman than she is pictured here, I lived with my grandparents full time and they raised me as their own. 

Nunu and Bub's love runs through all my work, every offering I've ever made and anything good whatsoever I've contributed to the world.

##What is this site?

I hand-built this site from scratch. It's an instance of [Bitters](http://bitters.gwenbell.com). It's Node.js, markdown, Jade and Stylus. I host it on a VPS and commit it to [Git](http://github.com/gwenbell).
		
I try to balance responding to messages with creating new work on the command line and in my writing. Sometimes a message turns into fodder for the work, which I always appreciate.

##How can I get in touch?

If you send me your life story and I have a dozen items plus to do that day, I might skim it. If you want to book me for consulting or speaking or anything weird please give me the wh's [gwen@ gwenbell.com](mailto:gwen@gwenbell.com). If you don't expect a response, please write NRN in closing. If you have a specific request, I ask that you front-load it, rather than burying it or tucking it in a postscript. Please don't send praise - instead, tell the lady in front of you in the checkout line how that color blue in her top really brings out her eyes.

##Who else engages in this work?

A writer isn't a writer without readers. All kinds of people all over the world engage with my work. Sometimes I meet them in person! And I'm always touched and blown away at the way my work in the world impacts theirs. Some of them share [their stories here](http://gwenbell.com/responses).

##How can I contribute?

I am an engineer. I am in the machine every day. One thing that means is I run this site on the command line. If you see an error, as you likely will, please [submit a pull request](https://github.com/gwenbell). If you can't submit a pull request, hmm. Ok. You have to start somewhere. You can start by <a href="http://git.gwenbell.com">learning Git</a>.

I took this picture in Chuckanut Forest in Washington State. That's where I've asked Ev to spread my ashes. There are faeries there. You must hold very still and look very close to see them.
