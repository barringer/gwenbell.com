About
=====

I'm a technical writer and Node.js programmer in Brooklyn, New York.

Before New York I spent 2012 traveling. I lived and wrote from Berlin, SF, Mexico, Singapore and Japan. I spent 3 months in each location. As I traveled, I searched for what's next in tech. I didn't find it, so I taught myself to program to build it myself.

My current writing focus [is Git](http://git.gwenbell.com) - content addressable key value store. My current programming focus is [Bitters](http://bitters.gwenbell.com) - a simple as possible Git-based Node.js instance, built in response to the bulky CMS's I now no longer have to use.

Read [Presence](/presence) to get the basics if you don't yet have them.

I earn a living from the products I create, and from what I think of as [micro-genius grants](http://gittip.com/gwenbell) - a transparent and anonymous recurring gift-giving system.

My personal computing history is this. I got my first laptop the same year I started practicing yoga, 1999. I taught myself HTML and CSS so I could make a website for my yoga studio in Japan. That was 2004. I've been in it ever since. 

The work I do on the mat shows up on the command line. I wrote the physical and mental practices that inform my work into [Presence](/presence).
