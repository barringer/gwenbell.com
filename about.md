About
-----

I did everything I wanted to do before I turned thirty. I figured I'd die at thirty, like mom did. So, as the imaginary clock wound down, I lived and lived and lived.

I've attended a week long _sesshin_ in Shizuoka, Japan. I started my first business in Kiryu, and my second in Yokohama, Japan. Both yoga studios (Paper Tiger and Yoga Garden, respectively). The first above an _izakaya_, the second on Motomachi, a fancy shopping street. I co-founded not one, but two, Buddhist podcasts.

I've watched a Berber woman be married, and learned Tashelheit from kids in the bled. I married a programmer, divorced a programmer, and then became a programmer. I've attended the funeral of a Japanese grandmother. I watched my first design firm, and my home, burn to the ground.

I've made thousands of dollars at speaking gigs. I've stripped at amateur strip night. I've been in a polyamorous relationship. I've been in commercials. I've been so drunk I've puked, in stilettos, at a toilet at Austin's biggest tech event. I've been on the cover of a magazine.

I've lived out of one bag for a year and a half, while traveling the world. I've lived in a hotel on the beach in Sayulita, Mexico for an entire month. I've overdrafted my bank account more than once. I once pushed myself so hard, I got so stressed, I gave myself Bells Palsy. I am child-free by choice, and I enjoy and respect the company of children.

I swing Stoic. I no longer call myself a student of Buddhism, but I think Stoicism is pretty spot on in reminding us _it could always be worse_.

I now believe that even though I've done everything I wanted to do, I may yet be at the start of my life. I don't have a bucket list because I do everything I'm called to do when it arises. I see each day as a miracle.

My work thrives when readers like you talk with others, over coffee or dinner, and definitely with your mobile device powered down or at least flipped over. Thank you for doing so through the years. It touches me to know the work I do impacts you.
