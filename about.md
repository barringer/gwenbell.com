<blockquote>What man can you show me who places any value on his time, who reckons the worth of each day, who understands that he is dying daily? For we are mistaken when we look forward to death; the major portion of death has already passed, whatever years behind us are in death's hands. - Seneca </blockquote>

Current: What I'm Working on and Why
------------------------------------

I taught myself to code in 2004. I lived in Kiryu-shi, Japan, at the time. I was a full-time teacher at Yamamae Shōgakkō, and I loved the work. I also wanted to extend myself, to try something harder than teaching the Apples and Bananas song. I was frustrated with the limitations of LiveJournal, and wanted to create my own site, from scratch. So I taught myself to code.

I went to Kinokuniya and bought what looked like the friendliest code book - a visual quickstart guide, with an orange and lime green cover. Then I parked myself in front of the machine. Before that I announced I would spend the weekend with only the company of Ari and Yuutsu, the red eared sliders. I said I was becoming a coder and I when/if returned I'd be sweaty, gross and in a terrible mood.

Flash forward. I built this site from scratch. I know the whole stack - which means, from VPS (virtual private server) to the final output on your screen and all the switches that are thrown to create what you see. I'm familiar with every line in it. I'm empowered knowing that.

This time around, I had similar frustrations. Like LiveJournal, every CMS I tried - and I tried all the big ones - Squarespace, WordPress, Joomla - fell short. I want something as close to the bone as possible. So I created it. I call it [Bitters](http://bitters.gwenbell.com). 

This time around the door in wasn't CSS and HTML because I am competent at those. This time, the door was Git. I taught myself Git, Jade, Stylus and Node.js because I wanted to push myself, to learn something new, and to have a skill set few others possess. 

When I first got into the game, there were few women in my life who knew anything about code. Now, nearly ten years later, that same statement is (to my mind, sadly) true. In response, I stopped chatting. 

Instead of chatting - (my stance is women in tech: [commit](http://git.gwenbell.com)) - instead of wishing things were different, I drop myself deeper into the machine. I teach myself more skills and deliver them to you as a technical writer. 

As a technical writer, I dedicate my time, love, energy and life force to creating work that helps more people get themselves onto the command line. 

I believe, and I practice my beliefs, that if we aren't writing the code, it writes us. It's now program or be programmed. 

I choose _to shape_ what comes next, _not just_ consume it.

Past: What I've been up to
--------------------------

I did everything I wanted to do before I turned thirty (I am now thirty-one). From the time I was eleven, I figured I'd die at thirty, as my mom did. While the imaginary clock wound down, I lived and lived and lived. To this day, I live and live and live. I consider all this bonus life.

I've attended a week long _sesshin_ in Shizuoka, Japan. I started my first business in Kiryu, and my second in Yokohama, Japan. Both yoga studios (Paper Tiger and Yoga Garden, respectively). The first above an _izakaya_, the second on Motomachi, a fancy shopping street. I co-founded not one, but two, Buddhist podcasts.

I've watched a Berber woman be married, and learned Tashelheit from kids in the bled. I married a programmer, divorced a programmer, and then became a programmer. I've attended the funeral of a Japanese grandmother. I watched my first design firm, and my home, burn to the ground.

I've made thousands of dollars at speaking gigs. I've stripped at amateur strip night. I've been in a polyamorous relationship. I've been in commercials. I've been so drunk I've puked, in stilettos, at a toilet at Austin's biggest tech event. I've been on the cover of a magazine.

I've lived out of one bag for a year and a half, while traveling the world. I've lived in a hotel on the beach in Sayulita, Mexico for an entire month. I've overdrafted my bank account more than once. I once pushed myself so hard, I got so stressed, I gave myself Bells Palsy. 

I am child-free by choice, and I enjoy and respect the company of children.

I swing Stoic. I no longer call myself a student of Buddhism, but I think Stoicism is pretty spot on in reminding us _it could always be worse_.

I now believe that even though I've done everything I wanted to do, I am likely at the start of my life. I don't have a bucket list because I do everything I'm called to do when it arises. I see each day as a miracle, an opportunity to make an offering. 

When I was a baby, my grandparents came to Florida and picked me and Mom up. She'd had me on her own, and they helped her out. This is me with my mom, Bub (her dad, my grandfather) and his mom, Nana. I was less than a year old. They were all giants to me.

My work thrives when readers like you talk with others about it over coffee or dinner, and definitely with your mobile device powered down or at least flipped over. Thank you for doing so through the years. It touches me to know the work I do impacts you.

To living while we're alive,
