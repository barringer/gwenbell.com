About
-----

I'm a technical writer and web developer. I live in Brooklyn, New York. I teach clients to live on the command line. I can show you how to commit with Git. I will help you learn to code. I believe we each have a choice now: program or be programmed. I choose to program.

I also choose to write. Most recently, all of 2012 I traveled the globe - Japan, Berlin, Singapore, Mexico and San Francisco - living out of one bag, doing the work every day. It wasn't until 2012 that I committed to becoming a full-time programmer as well as writer. 

You can do both.

I introduced myself to someone in my favorite ramen shop today. She was saying she wasn't sure if you can be both a programmer and an extravert. In my experience, you can. But it might break you. It broke me. But, that's how I roll. It has been worth it to get still and go quiet and learn the command line.

If you're learning and have questions, [be in touch](mailto:gwen@gwenbell.com). If you want something to read to learn about Git, I [can help with that](http://git.gwenbell.com). If you just want to see a responsive site built on a combination of Jade, Stylus, Markdown and Node.js, you're looking at it. I appreciate [pull requests](http://github.com/gwenbell) of all stripe.
