<blockquote>What man can you show me who places any value on his time, who reckons the worth of each day, who understands that he is dying daily? For we are mistaken when we look forward to death; the major portion of death has already passed, whatever years behind us are in death's hands. - Seneca </blockquote>

<blockquote>Bitch I hustle every day, you could check my resum√©. - A$AP Rocky</blockquote>

I did everything I wanted to do before I turned thirty (I am now thirty-one). From the time I was eleven, I figured I'd die at thirty, as my mom did. While the imaginary clock wound down, I lived and lived and lived. To this day, I live and live and live. I consider all this bonus life.

I've attended a week long _sesshin_ in Shizuoka, Japan. I started my first business in Kiryu, and my second in Yokohama, Japan. Both yoga studios (Paper Tiger and Yoga Garden, respectively). The first above an _izakaya_, the second on Motomachi, a fancy shopping street. I co-founded not one, but two, Buddhist podcasts.

I've watched a Berber woman be married, and learned Tashelheit from kids in the bled. I married a programmer, divorced a programmer, and then became a programmer. I've attended the funeral of a Japanese grandmother. I watched my first design firm, and my home, burn to the ground.

I've made thousands of dollars at speaking gigs. I've stripped at amateur strip night. I've been in a polyamorous relationship. I've been in commercials. I've been so drunk I've puked, in stilettos, at a toilet at Austin's biggest tech event. I've been on the cover of a magazine.

I've lived out of one bag for a year and a half, while traveling the world. I've lived in a hotel on the beach in Sayulita, Mexico for an entire month. I've overdrafted my bank account more than once. I once pushed myself so hard, I got so stressed, I gave myself Bells Palsy. 

I am child-free by choice, and I enjoy and respect the company of children.

I swing Stoic. I no longer call myself a student of Buddhism, but I think Stoicism is pretty spot on in reminding us _it could always be worse_.

I now believe that even though I've done everything I wanted to do, I am likely at the start of my life. I don't have a bucket list because I do everything I'm called to do when it arises. I see each day as a miracle, an opportunity to make an offering. 

When I was a baby, my grandparents came to Florida and picked me and Mom up. She'd had me on her own, and they helped her out. This is me with my mom, Bub (her dad, my grandfather) and his mom, Nana. I was less than a year old. They were all giants to me.
