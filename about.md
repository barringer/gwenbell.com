About
-----

I'm a [technical writer](http://git.gwenbell.com) and [programmer](http://bitters.gwenbell.com) in Brooklyn, New York. Read my [open source report card](http://osrc.dfm.io/gwenbell) or view my [commits](https://github.com/gwenbell).

Before New York, in 2012 I lived and wrote from Berlin, SF, Mexico, Singapore and Japan. I spent 3 months in each location. As I traveled, I searched for what's next in tech. I didn't find what I was after, so I taught myself to program.

####Programming Roots

I got my first laptop the same year I started practicing yoga, 1999. In 2004 I taught myself HTML and CSS so I could make a website for my yoga studio in Japan. I've been at it ever since.
