About
=====

As of June 2013 I'm a technical writer and Node.js programmer in Brooklyn, New York. Here's my [open source report card](http://osrc.dfm.io/gwenbell).

In 2012 I lived and wrote from Berlin, SF, Mexico, Singapore and Japan. I spent 3 months in each location. As I traveled, I searched for what's next in tech. I didn't find it, so I taught myself to program.

I earn a living from the products I create, and from what I think of as [micro-genius grants](http://gittip.com/gwenbell) - a transparent and anonymous recurring gift-giving system.

I got my first laptop the same year I started practicing yoga, 1999. In 2004 I taught myself HTML and CSS so I could make a website for my yoga studio in Japan. I've been at it ever since. 

The work I do on the mat shows up on the command line. I wrote the physical and mental practices that inform my work into [Presence](/presence).
