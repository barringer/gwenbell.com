About
-----

I'm a technical fiction writer and web developer based in Brooklyn, New York. I teach clients to live on the command line, commit to Git and code their own way.

People tell me they want my life. You may think, when you see me from afar, just on the web, I have this fantastic life. Constant fun. It looks like I just run around the Japaneast Village of New York eating pork ramen following a sweaty yoga class.

Reality is, I'm a miserable git. _That_ is why you don't want to hang out with me. I work all day, every day to make it look effortless. Even when I'm on the mat, I'm wringing out what's next. When I sleep, I dream in Jade lang. And you seeing me like that. You'll see. It isn't fun. It's work.

And that will break your reality. You might think you want my life, you want to clone or co-work with me. You don't. When people sit across the table from me on their machines, they _can't handle it_. 

It's hard work being a full-time miserable git.
