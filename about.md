About
=====

I live in Brooklyn, New York. Bed-Stuy _represent_.

I moved to the city in March 2013, having spent 2012 traveling the globe (Berlin with a stop over in London, Singapore, Japan, and Mexico). As I traveled all I owned fit into [this bag](http://missionworkshop.com/products/advanced_projects/vx-rucksack.php), and I was able to support each leg of the journey by doing the work. As I traveled, I looked for what's next in tech and didn't find it out there, so I decided to program it myself.

I am now in the lucky position of being able to [write](http://git.gwenbell.com) and [program](http://gwenbell.com/git) for a living. I write to [inboxes](https://tinyletter.com/gwenbell) and the public web. I earn cash from the products I create, and from what I think of as [micro-genius grants](http://gittip.com/gwenbell).

This is a day in my life.
-------------------------

I wake up each morning early to get a writing and programming session in before the rest of the house awakens. I live with three housemates, <del>partner</del> <del>lover</del> <a href="http://evbogue.com">star twin</a> and a cat.

I wake up to the sound of birds chirping and cars rolling. I pull on a pair of socks and shuffle across the hard wood floors to the kitchen. This morning I boiled water for tea, rather than making espresso. Usually I have a tiny espresso cup of Caf√© Bustelo

The first thing I do when I open my laptop is power it on. Then I 

	$ command space 

into the terminal. 

From the terminal, I open my text editor, Sublime Text 2. 

Once open, I start writing from the top. When I'm done with my morning writing session, I take a bath.

I usually eat huevos rancheros or cranberry cinnamon oatmeal for breakfast.

The afternoon gets kicked off with a strategy session with [Ven](http://twitter.com/venportman). After the strategy session, most days I walk either to the Bed-Stuy donut shop for a chocolate covered cocao nib donut and the Janet Jackson that's usually playing. 

Or, I eat and then walk to Manhattan. 

While in Manhattan, I eat 2 Bros because I find the marinara sauce tasty and it's a dollar a slice. I add a section or two to whatever living documents I'm currently writing. I get in my [commits](http://github.com/gwenbell) for the day by making site tweaks, clicking around on the faces of programmers whose work I [follow](http://twitter.com/gwenbell) and working on [Bitters](http://bitters.gwenbell.com).

Throughout the day I see a wide variety of people come through my front door. I commune with faeries and dead people by astral planking at least once a day. I do late night forward folds with the candles lit. Each week I go to [yoga to the people](http://yogatothepeople.com) to have myself stretched by the collective.

Most days I walk 10,000+ steps. I've discovered doing so blank slates me. 

In the evenings, I connect with my housemates, program and practice yoga, do long-form writing and [conduct inbox correspondence](mailto:gwen@gwenbell.com). 

I go to bed by midnight most nights. The last thing I do before I fall asleep is appreciations.

<hr />

Speaking of appreciations, you can read what readers, clients and fellow travelers [have to say](http://gwenbell.com/responses) about the quality and care I put into the work.

<hr />

I love to be challenged and I double love juicy questions. 

If you have programming questions, especially to do with Node basics, Git, Express, Jade, Stylus or Markdown - that's the beat I'm currently working - [send them](mailto:gwen@gwenbell.com). I read each message that crosses my screen, even if I don't reply right away. If you want my immediate response, submit a [pull request](http://github.com/gwenbell). I love merging pull requests!
