The era of personal narrative _is over_. 

If you want to make it on the web, you have to boost your technical skills. That's the only thing left that people will pay you for. And even that, India's watching. (Note, I don't begrudge India that. Mofos know how to hustle.)

Nobody wants to pay you for personal narrative anymore; people believe they're _entitled_ to it.

<hr />

In 2008 or thereabouts I found myself at a tech event. Soft tech. Blogging. I was at this shindig in the backyard of an 'industry' guy who has since done some of the shadiest shit known to man - which is ok, [BJ Mendelson](http://bjmendelson.com/) is _on_ his ass. 

At the event, I was wearing cherry red four-inch platform shoes.

Anyway, this woman clumps up with her thousand dollar camera and says, Gwen Bell. I'll just say it since nobody else will. I hate you. I hate your long long beautiful legs and I was tempted to trip you, just to spite you. Just to **stop your strut**. 

Then she laughed loud and full all, _just kiddin' girlfriend_. 

I shrugged it off but did not forget.

At least she was honest and direct. She was telling the truth. People have been jealous of what I get up to since I was old enough to understand what jealousy was, so probably elementary school. Usually I shrugged it off, and for a time, I rolled that energy into my work and just kept telling stronger, better stories.

That stopped yesterday. 

**Yesterday, I ended the contract with my literary agent.** I called it off, she was gracious about it, and I am grateful for that. 

The book I thought I'd publish was personal narrative. Memoir. To this day, people email asking for it. Gwen Bell. Write your memories. You have _such_ a _fascinating_ life _story_. Recently I've taken to interpreting that as _Gwen Bell. I hate you. Why do you have to have such a great life?_

Since I announced I'd be divorcing, and then got the divorce, the jealousy around my personal life appears to have increased. You'd think it'd decrease, right? It hasn't. Why? **My guess: people want divorces like a fat kid wants another donut.** 

(You can't have both, but I can.)

People, including people like you reading these words right now, are afraid to get a divorce. And I had the balls and chutzpah to do it. I got one. 

That adds a whole new level to the jealousy. People not knowing why they're jealous of my misfortune. Yet, they are. They see me hitting my stride in 2013, and they're all, shit. How's she doing this _after_ a divorce. She should be staring at the bottom of another ice cream vat.

They see the divorce as unfortunate. I see it as I don't even have a word for it, so I'll use a phrase. **I'm free, bitches!**

Haha. 

And if you were thinking a man will bail you out, you're wrong. Wrong, wrong riggity wrong. Don't be that kind of wrong. 

I proved that. All of it, by the time I turned thirty. A man is not going to bail you out, yo. You are. Only you. Occasionally a kind soul or twelve will throw you a [gittip](http://gittip.com/gwenbell), but no Man Plan will cut it.

And still. After all that. I am still in possession of the long legs, the great figure, the beautiful apartment in Brooklyn, the daily donut habit, the tremendous yoga practice, the grandparents who love me and the guy match with whom I spend a lot of my time. 

So. Why'm I telling you this?

Because I'm telling it for the last time.

Today I deleted all but the two pertinent paragraphs from my about page. 

_You don't care_ about my about page. Nor do I care about yours. 

YOU care about your about page. 

YOU care about your Twitter feed. 

YOU care who retweets you. 

I do not.

In 2011 during a speaking engagement I told a roomful of women bloggers I don't use RSS because **I don't read anybody's blog**. Time stopped. There was a collective gasp. Like how _dare_ I say that. They thought of themselves as peers. I thought of them as potential customers.

I'm usually two years ahead of things on the tech front, so now it's two years later. Whose blog do you read? Whose site do you contribute to or care about, other than your own?

(Side note, in response to this I got dozens of thank you messages for saying what's been on your minds. So, to let you know, I'm not alone in not reading your blog.)

On a recent call a reader (I'll venture _former reader_ after this) asked why I don't subscribe to her updates. On the spot, I came clean. What I've seen of your life, I said...well, I already know too much. Why would I subscribe to more drama?

I don't do drama. 

I haven't clicked back to her site since. She was right to put me on the spot. Not even a little drama? _Not even a little_. It's _shenpa_. It's the itch you shouldn't scratch. The scab you shouldn't pick.

Shenpa. _That_ is why I don't have a F-book account. That and I think it's a terrible color blue. Same reason I don't have a phone - lots of drama comes of doing business over the phone.

Also like the blogging women of 2011, she's a potential client, not a peer. You want to be a peer, up your [technical skills game](http://git.gwenbell.com).

So. Here's what I'm gonna do. Right now. I'll tell you one last final personal narrative. It's also the secret to all I've done to date and will do in the future and if you have any reason to be jealous of me, it's this.

**How to Ditch the Story and Upgrade Your Game**

Hi. I'm Gwen Bell. I'm a developer. I'm obsessed with Git. 

And you. Let's talk about you. 

There are two groups of people who subscribe to my work. 

On one side of the room, I have the ladies. You email me telling me you don't want to learn technical skills. You wish you had the energy, time, the [Presence](/presence), to sit down and learn something hard. You say you can't be fucked. 

Why? You say it's because you care more about my personal life than my professional abilities. You want to hear more stories, more creative writing, more memoir. That's a lie.

Really, women, isn't what you want more _drama_? Isn't what you want is one more distraction so you don't have to look at yourself and your life?

On the other side of the room there are the people who support my work. I hate to say it. No, really I do hate to say it, because I want it to be false, but those of you who support my work are almost exclusively men. Men with technical skills. Men who live in on the West or East coast in an above average city. Men from Germany and London, New York and SF. Men who usually have excellent senses of style and humor. (Thank you, guys.)

I'll throw a few of you ladies in this camp. Most of you in this camp are pretty manly ladies if I may say so. I include myself in this camp - you can smell my pits and find out. You're not the kitten-keeping-call-your-girlfriends-and-catch-up-on-the-latest-drama-box-wine type. 

You're dedicated to your craft. 

You know beyond doubt the only way you're going to get ahead in life is by learning more than you already know.

See. Right then? I just gave you the secret.

And the men. You know what? When you email, you have specific questions about technical things you want to achieve in the digital space. I love these types of emails.

So we have these two camps. The art-school drama-obsessed women of the social web, and the technically skilled men and women of the open Internet.

I'm at a fork. Do I continue to cater to the women out there? Do I keep writing more tidbits about my life, or do I go 100% into the deep end with writing about dev work?

Who am I going to keep on the list, and who'm I going to fire?

I'm letting the money speak. The camp with the most cash gets the most votes.

I'm pulling up my sales from April and May. I'm looking at my list of sales here on Fetchapp. And...scans sales...you know what I see?

**The men and women with the technical skills have won.**

Why? Because they're the highest earners. The men are bringing home the most and juiciest bacon.

So here's what I've decided to do. 

I let my literary agent go yesterday. The last artschool drama you'll ever read from me has been packaged up into [Presence](/presence). 

It's a little document sent to me by the faeries to teach your tender hearts tech. If you want to hear more personal narrative, you will buy it. My housemate told me she loved it. Her favorite part was the interview with Biggie Smalls. She also really enjoyed the interview my mom gave - it is my first, and to date only - interview with my mom.

Me? I'm pivoting 100% into the development world. 

If you don't know what I mean when I say I'm [Committed to Git](http://git.gwenbell.com). If your only presence on the web is your F-book account, I hope you lock yourself in. Stay there. I cannot help you.

You vote with your money and in exchange I care about those of you who have put down credit cards. The money has voted, and we have our decision.

It's technical writing and web development here on out.

Do you have the ability to sit still and concentrate long enough to learn some hard shit? If not, get out of my inbox. You're fired. I don't want to hear from you until you're ready to commit. 

To the work. The work is now Git, Node.js, JavaScript, the terminal and the inner workings of that machine you're parked at day in, day out.

Jealousy? Hate? I just gave you another dozen reasons for both.

And here's the _final_ final thought. I don't wear platforms anymore. I don't have to be cute. 

I wear Chucks. So now motherfuckers, I don't strut. 

_I run._

###Total Buy-in

<p class="lead">What if you could let the part of your brain with EARN stamped on it rest for a while? Or forever?</p>

I watched Synecdoche, New York yesterday. Then I walked from Brooklyn to Manhattan, New York as the sun set. I walked a total of 16,557 steps, which according to my iPod Nano watch was 7.83 miles. I saw four condoms in various states of used. I saw two people sleeping on the street. I saw one woman with platinum hair run from one end to the other and back in the time it took me to get to the end of the Williamsburg bridge.

Ev suggested Synecdoche because he knows my love for intense programming. 

My two favorite shows of all time are Six Feet Under, which I watched in its entirety as I learned to program last year. And The Wire, which I almost gave up on because I was bored stiff during the first episode. I stayed with it only because Madeleine Forbes and Ev were all, "give it a chance, man," and now I love it.

The other reason Ev suggested Synecdoche is since the start of the week I've given a lot of thought to genius grants. These things actually exist. They're called MacArthur Fellowships. It's all anonymous, which is also true for [Gittip](http://gittip.com), which I view as distributed, peer-to-peer genius grants. Lots of people supporting each other financially so they can work on and do what they love. Those who have more to give, contribute more. Those who are doing the work and need more support, get more.

In Synecdoche, the main character, Caden Cotard (played by Philip Seymour Hoffman) is given one such genius grant (though in his case it's a lump-sum from higher up, rather than little bits from lots of people - his is vertical, rather than horizontal) about a quarter of the way through the film. He goes from getting by to having so much income he can do whatever he wants with his time and never thinks about earning again. 

He lets the part of his brain stamped EARN take a permanent vacation.

Sounds great! But when you think about it, especially if you've watched The Wire, you know what I mean when I say The Hustle gives you Purpose. It does. The drive to get some product out the door gives you laser-like focus, and without the boundaries of 'you're running out of cashmoney', you've got to get that pushback from _somewhere_.

Caden Cotard is tragic - not semi-tragic, not kinda pathetic melancholy in an Eternal Sunshine kinda way. No, I find him flat-out tragic. This play he's making, funded by the genius grant, goes on for most of eternity, and I don't want to spoil the plot, but there's really no saving graces to this guy. I keep wanting for there to be. But with unlimited funding, it's like he has a permanent case of The Resistance.

If you read my work during 2011 and 2012, you know I got obsessed with The Resistance. After I read _The War of Art_ I started seeing The Resistance everywhere, in everybody, including myself. I couldn't not see it. I was grateful Steven Pressfield had written, finally, the truth about getting things into the world. He covered, in a slim volume, basically every kind of cop out, every excuse I had for not doing the work. Once I got to the end I was all, 'huh. I've done every single one of these things. Now that I know about the Resistance, I'll aim to never have it again!' 

That has almost but not quite worked out. 

Anyway, Caden has The Resistance (which, by the way, is contagious), but there's something more pernicious at play. He spends the duration of the film trying to get buy-in. From anybody. His wife, his second wife, his daughter, the people in the play he's staging. He wants them to say you're an alright kinda guy Caden. You're doing your best. And even when they _do_ say that, he never takes it to heart. He keeps berating himself, wishing he could get _total buy-in_ from _the whole world_. Failing that, he keeps plugging on this play, trying to get _it_ perfect. (Trying to get it perfect is a symptom of the Resistance. You have to hit publish, even if you think it's shit, which you always a little bit will. Think it's shit, that is.)

The only person who can give you total buy-in on your life is you.

There's also no pleasure to this guy's life. He's so caught up in his own _dukkha_ which means dissatisfaction in Buddhist, that he can't see straight. Sure, he fucks but it's always sad. You know, like he's hoping he could perform a little better. He's weepy and self-absorbed. (Contrast that with self-contained.) 

He never merges with his lover. He holds her at arm's length, wanting, you guessed it. 

Total buy-in.

The only person who will give you total buy-in is you. That's why when someone says to me, 'Oh, I could never write like you do. My life's not that interesting,' I take them at their word. 

I see they haven't bought into their own story.

This isn't to say you don't have to drop the story-_line_. My work isn't just in telling masturbatory stories I like to write that you'll like to read. It's also unplugging for two years to listen to my own voice. To discover whether what I'm telling you is true is true for me, or is it just what you (they, the group/collective) want to hear.

Returning after two years away, I'm clearer now on my voice than I was when I left. And. It turns out, the voice isn't that much different. That's one thing I've enjoyed about being back on Twitter this week. Oh! Here I am. And I'm not a whole lot different than when I blank-slated.

Which. Is why I blank the slate. What remains after you blank the slate is as close to true as you're going to get. And you're never going to get to total blank. 

You will never come out clean.

That is what I love about Six Feet Under. None of those characters come out clean, and still, I forgive each one. I forgive them their foibles and 'shortcomings'. 

I forgive the parts of them I thought I couldn't forgive in myself.

They remind me I can let myself off the hook. Caden never lets himself off the hook. He never builds his pleasure palette. He never takes stock of what brings him geniune pleasure.

And I wonder if that's because _he never bottoms out_. I've bottomed out so many times now. I chuckle when I think about them. I don't think my mini-tragedies are actually all that tragic. Yes, of course, hard at the time. Yes, if you're going through hell keep going. But maybe it was during these past two years during a self-chosen exile that showed me: it could always be worse. And it has made pleasure _that much easier_ to touch, each moment.

I didn't always say that. I used to say, "this is the worst thing of all time!" High drama. I'd fling myself on the couch and have a cry for the afternoon.

But when I turn anything on its head and say, "it could always be worse," and "what's the worst that could happen here?" I see the situation differently. That difference, though slim, hasn't just once saved my life. It keeps saving my life.

Whether you think mine is a life worth living means not a whit to me. 

Because the person who has to demonstrate total buy-in is me.

And I do.

###An Engineer Like You

Last week I called my grandfather, whom I call Bub. I called Bub to remind him of when I was little and I'd beg to go with him to the hospital. Bub worked shift work his whole life, and most of the time I knew him growing up, he did the shift work in a hospital. 

We're both engineers, though he did his work AFK. He never used a computer for work, but he did have a man cave he'd go into when he got to the hospital to start his shift, and that was one of the things I liked best about it. That there was this secret place in this ginormous hospital where he, and sometimes I, could go hide out. 

The engineering break room was long and narrow with a bed in the back against the wall. There was a pinup calendar with voluptuous women in tiny outfits in front of motorcycles. The room smelled of tools, of grease and of men, since those were the only things in there most of the time.

I actually hated hospitals is the thing. I didn't want to be in the hospital itself, because it was the same place my mom spent a lot of her five years dying.

Anyway, engineering. Bub's shift. The thing is. When I called him to remind him of how I loved going into work with him, he didn't start reflecting back what I was expecting to hear. He said

_Honey, you remember when you wanted to take a shower out there after the hurricane?_

_No, what do you mean take a shower? At the hospital?_

_Mmhmm, right. I took you in there in the Renault and you remember that curve at the KOA, a tree came right in through the windshield. Whole tree branch._

_OhmygodBub. I could have died!_

_Sure right you could have. Nearly got your face, I... (he trails) You don't remember that?_

_Well, huh. Yeah, no. I guess I don't._

_Well, we turned back and got a different car. And then I got that generator so you could take showers. Yup, sure did._

<hr /> 

Sometimes I don't get out of him what I went into the call for, but I get something that jump starts another line of thinking. Which of course is ok with me. Bub's in his seventies now, which you'd think would dull him. But the opposite has happened. He remembers a whole set of data that I have altogether forgotten. He has an engineering mind, he sees systems I don't.

Looking at the hospital as an engineer isn't the same as being a patient there. I didn't feel scared when I hung with Bub. Even when very little, when I felt lonely or sad or tired I'd grab a hand, and his hands were usually a little greasy, and always warm. And I knew I could trust him as we navigated the labyrinthine hospital up to the roof. Where we'd check in on the fans. And then down to the generator room, which was still running during the hurricane, hence the shower I was able to take.

The generators can't go down at a hospital. That's the mission critical room. Generators make it so any terrible thing can happen and those patients on respirators, those patients who are in compromised situations, they still get the support they need.

<hr />

As I've become an engineer myself, I experience the joy and challenge of being relied upon. Not relied upon as in if this goes down, people will die. I'm not that kind of engineer. But when I see an ECONNREFUSED I know there are people on the other side of their machines getting something other than they expect. I go into the generator room that is my virtual private server, and I start -ef'ing around, killing and restarting processes.

And, I go into diagnosis mode. If I can't right the ship immediately, I step away from the machine and reapproach again, once I've thought about it.

Becoming an engineer has slowed me down. I think in a different way now. 

I like to imagine I think more like Bub.

<hr />

Before we hung up the call I said

_Hey Bub, listen. I don't think I've ever really told you this, but I respect the work you've done. Thank you for showing me how I could become an engineer like you._

_Mmhmm, well, alright honey. Call your grandmother, she's over at Et's._
