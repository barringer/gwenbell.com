Writing
=======

From 2011 to 2012 I wrote to inboxes as I traveled the globe. Singapore, Mexico, San Francisco, Europe, Japan. What was I looking for out there? When you travel you're either running from or towards something. As I wrote I looked for what was next in tech. I didn't find it, and I didn't find it, but I still kept traveling. As I wrote and traveled it suddenly occurred to me. I'm not finding it because I am going to be the one who will build it.

I have to create what I'm trying to find out here in the world.

I taught myself the version control system, [Git](http://git.gwenbell.com). I taught myself to deploy [Node](http://deployno.de). I taught myself Linux and the command line. Once I'd done that I was ready to create the publishing container I want in [Bitters](http://bitters.gwenbell.com). Now I help others onto the command line, into Git and publishing with something that is not a botnet or a pain in the ass. 

This is not easy work, as nothing worth doing is. But now that I've created the container I want to publish to, I'm publishing to the public web again. And it's exciting. Not just to be publishing to the public again, but to do it from a place in the world I love: New York City. 

I love it. I love this play of write, write, code. This git push and pull, this city that hums and thumps and sings. This is where I want to be in the world; I've discovered the place, the people, the pace. I place to build and create and nourish and yes, my god, put down a little root and water it.

If there were anywhere else in the world, I would know it. 

I am here now, for the ghosts - and for the living - that I've done, that I have yet to do. 

See you on the command line, or in The City.
