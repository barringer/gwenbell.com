Writing
=======

I survived, and that was enough
-------------------------------

**Marriage**

In high school, I was friends with Sam. I'm calling him Sam even though that wasn't his name.

Sam's family was into canoeing. I had never been and when I got the invite, I said sure. So off we went, that family and me. And on the day in question I shared a canoe with Sam.

The trip started, and Sam taught me all he knew about how to put my paddle into the water. Not like a flapping, not hitting the water's surface, but more like this, turn it, ease it in, that's it. On its side like that. We just went and went on the river. And it was sunny, and I was having a good time, even though I didn't talk much. It was exhausting enough just getting the paddle into the water right.

Then, we got to our destination. Some place with shade, and Sam's mom had packed us sandwiches, which I tried to eat, but I noticed even then that my arms had spaghettified. It took effort to bring the sandwich to my face. And that was my first indication - I might have overextended myself. 

**Divorce**

On the bank, my arms were already aching. I'd gotten sun and was dehydrated. I was hungrier than the sandwich was filling. But, the weather was turning. It was getting darker, and the sun was starting to fade in and out with the clouds. We had to start back, though we were already tired.

We made it back to camp. The next day I did very little. I had almost no energy. I didn't feel any closer to Sam back at camp than I had the day before the canoe trip. We'd just taken a trip together. Six or seven hours, taking turns paddling. Though we'd shared a canoe, I sensed we'd had two very different experiences.

It wasn't _getting somewhere_ that exhausted me, though it had. For me, though paddling out was arduous, it was the return trip that did me in.

*

I can't tell you everything that happened on that trip, though I will say I haven't gone canoeing since. I survived, and that was enough.

I will say the same of going through both marriage and divorce in under three years; I survived, and that was enough.

Blank page. Deep breath.

Three candles, in a line on the table. Tiny espresso cups. A writer across from me. Notes, notes, notes. The Leica. The watch. The noodles leftover from dinner because I ate the good parts out and left the noodles.

The sound of the drummer practicing downstairs. The glow of the candles. The glow of the keyboards. Siren whizzes by.

You know this is it. 

That's why I sat down with her in the park today. That's why I work the command line now. That's why I write. It's why I created exactly the container I want with Bitters. I didn't know I'd turn out a programmer, but I did know I'd turn out a writer. 

Not so much writer as refiner.

Not so much programmer as brick layer, container maker.

I get it now. The wisdom of no escape is there is no escape. 

I wouldn't want to anyway.

No kidding.

Yesterday a rat ran in front of me and disappeared by jumping through a chain link fence. 

I have bruises on my head, legs and arms from running into things - I'm in an unfamiliar city, in an unfamiliar part of that city, in an unfamiliar living situation. 

Someone suggested "dissatisfaction" may be a better way to express suffering (_dukkha_). But I'm not dissatisfied with my life or where I'm at or what I'm discovering. 

I'm not dissatisfied as the sun filters through the budding tree in front of Counter Culture, but I am aware of suffering.

This afternoon I saw a cop car roll up and cuff, then carry away, a man who was missing at least one front tooth. 

His offense, at least from my vantage point, was throwing a sandwich into the street.

--

Life leapt forward a week ago.

It leapt in a way I didn't expect. 
It leapt without my permission.
It leapt without my signing a contract, without my fully understanding the leap was happening. 

Now that that's that, I'm in Brooklyn at least through the first week of May. After that, it's unclear. 

I'm not dissatisfied, though. I'm practicing in a time of uncertainty.

As if there were times other than those that are uncertain.

--

I was reading _When Things Fall Apart_ the night before the morning of September 11, 2001. (That would make it September 10, 2001.) I was incredulous at the news that a plane had flown into a building - one of _the_ buildings in New York City. 

It started to click then that getting comfortable with uncertainty isn't a book you read. 

It isn't a conversation you have in a cafe. 

It is a life you live.

Patrick called late that night (or early that morning). I was due to fly to London less than 72 hours later. He was in Turkmenistan. My grandmother told me she was scared when the phone rang at that hour (2ish? 3ish?) - when she heard a language she didn't recognize on the other end of the line. When the call dropped.

Two days later as the escalator took me up to Departures, she and my grandfather reminded me - I didn't have to go. I could stay. I could just wait it out.

Wait until what?

I couldn't stay.
I couldn't wait it out.

In Sharon Salzberg's hotel room in Raleigh, North Carolina. Preparing for an interview, the subject of suffering came up. Sharon laughed in a way that filled that small room.

Suffering, she said, can't be compared. 

Suffering is like a gas; it fills whatever container it's in.

--

There's something true in the blunt edge of suffering; no dissatisfaction in sight.

It's a rat. It's a missing tooth. 
It's suffering.

Nothing to do but lean in.
Nothing to do but pay attention.
