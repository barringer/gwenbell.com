### What is presence?

**Presence is practices, experience-based experiments, things to do to manage your attention, hone your focus, get clarity around your message, and be present for yourself and others**

_Presence_ is a curated collection of the work I created from 2011 to 2012 + Terminal: Dead people on tech. It started in Boulder in 2011 and ends in Brooklyn in 2013.

You go out for coffee. You spend an inordinate amount of time texting in the restroom. You don't have to tell her what you were doing in there when you return. She notices your lack of it. What's lacking is your presence.

It is not what we say. It's not what we create. Although, yes our words and creations precede and follow us. It is _our presence_ that matters. Our presence is something we can only offer while we're alive. 

We can only offer our presence _once_. In the moment we are in. Post-death, we offer stand-ins for our presence - book titles, movie credits, bylines, grave markers, holographic representations. 

Your presence? It is irreplicable.

### Digital Warriorship

#### Gwen Bell | Feb 2011

To be present for others, first see and hear yourself. 

Align your real self with your digital self. My path from scrolling for empathy to taking digital sabbaticals and what I learned. Here's an introduction to start developing your presence.

### Attention Detox

#### Gwen Bell | Jan 2012

An Attention Detox helps you keep track of your attention for 168 hours. It's guaranteed to bring into focus how distracted you are, and what you need to do reclaim your attention.

The original version included a guided version - I watched, shared observations and guided participants. The attention detox included with Presence is self-guided.

### Reverb

#### Gwen Bell | March 2012

It’s a reverberation when the desire to see it chart its own path becomes greater than the urge to control it. (I think that’s also a definition of love.)

Once you're aligned, your message can travel. Reverb started as #best09 and became #reverb10. From hundreds of participants in year one, to thousands in year two, the project reverberated through the web, generating over 1k pages of tweets in just one month. Here's how that, and other successful reverberations, happened.

### Digital Warriorship II

#### Gwen Bell | June 2012

Experiments in paying better, closer attention.

When I check out, I check in with myself to course-correct. I determine the cause of the check out, and I spend time determining the best route to getting back in the flow. Sometimes, that means a year off the public web, as it did in 2012. During that time I wrote Digital Warriorship again, this time in Kyoto, Japan.

### Terminal

#### Gwen Bell | June 2013

When you buy Presence, you'll also get Terminal.

Terminal is dead people on tech. I have conversations with Steve Jobs, Alan Watts, Biggie Smalls, Audrey Hepburn, a cameo from Marilyn Monroe, Rilke, Nina Simone, Jean Dominique-Bauby, my mom, faeries and you freshly dead.

They showed up in the bath tub one day and I wrote down what they said.

I added it to _Presence_ because it rounds it out. It's the final nail in the coffin.

### Why presence?

In Japan, whether or not someone does business with you is based on their first impression. They do a presence check. Perhaps we all do that.

In yoga class this week in New York, the teacher instructed his students: take your phones off your mats, put them in your bags, unless you can justify them to me. Nobody even _attempted_ to justify their phone. If we can't justify it, why don't we make that same choice daily? What if you can?

Money. Can't take that with you when you die.

Presence? Can't give _that_ from the grave.

_Presence_ includes a PDF of Digital Warriorship I, Digital Warriorship II, Reverb and the Attention Detox, for just $97. As of June 2013, it includes the bonus, Terminal as an HTML document.

My writing will continue to be about hard technical skills, as I cover in [Git Commit](http://git.gwenbell.com). If you don't have down the fundamentals I cover in _Presence_, your learning curve with hard technical skills will be that much steeper. 

I would not have become a programmer if I had not done the things that I rolled into _Presence_.
