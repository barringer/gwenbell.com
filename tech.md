###Foo Camp: What's next in tech?

<p class='lead'>In March 2009 I got an invite.</p> 

I was in Mexico. I was at the pool, and I'd left all my machines back in the States to be offline and rest. I got an invite. It came over email on a crappy Dell in the computer lab.

It was from [Dave Morin](http://davemorin.com/). He was inviting me to something that seemed quite mysterious. I love mysterious shit.

He said it would go down in Sebastapol, California. It was scheduled for April, about a week and a half after I returned from Mexico. I'd have to pay my own way but it's sort of an outdoors/indoors sleep-anywhere-camp kind of event. Come learn with fellow technologists changing the world. Social Web Foo Camp. Friends of O'Reilly. That O'Reilly. The guy who publishes all the tech books with the weird animals on the cover that you buy, collect and sometimes read. (I hope you _do_ actually read them, by the way.)

I remember wondering why they'd invited me. And then, I emailed back and said yes to Foo. Then I sat by the pool and all I thought about was technology: where is the web, where is it going, who will build it and how can I help?

**FOO**

Foo. You have no idea. The brains in that group. 

It was off the record, intentionally. So people felt free to be vulnerable, ask hard questions, push back against giants in the web slice we inhabited. Everybody was there. Any major social site you could think, someone was there from it. But not the talkers - the _doers_ the guys, mostly guys, who were architecting the web in which we now spend huge portions of our day.

<hr />

At one point I went for waffles with two guys. [One of them was Flickr's lead engineer](http://www.iamcal.com/). [The other'd built Delicious from the ground up](https://twitter.com/joshu). I remember thinking to myself, I'm hungry and can't wait for those waffles but holy fucking shit I am in a moving vehicle with two of the brightest humans on the planet. 

I didn't talk much, I just listened - and these guys, their brilliance is not in what they say, it's in what they don't say. They were witty. They were smart, and not just smart, they were thinking on the edge.

So in 2009, the seed was already planted for me to become an engineer. I _had to_ after that. I saw then that _talking about_ what was happening on the web and _building for_ the web are two different things. And if I was going to be talking with anyone, I wanted it to be these guys. And the only way I'd have anything to say was if I had the chops.

So, I started on the path to become a programmer.

And a few years later, after traveling the globe living out of one bag asking everyone I met, 'what's next in tech?' I sat down and taught myself what I needed to to answer my own question.

You may have guessed the answer. 

What's next in tech is what my peers and I commit today.

<p class="lead">What if you could let the part of your brain with EARN stamped on it rest for a while? Or forever?</p>

I watched Synecdoche, New York yesterday. Then I walked from Brooklyn to Manhattan, New York as the sun set. I walked a total of 16,557 steps, which according to my iPod Nano watch was 7.83 miles. I saw four condoms in various states of used. I saw two people sleeping on the street. I saw one woman with platinum hair run from one end to the other and back in the time it took me to get to the end of the Williamsburg bridge.

Ev suggested Synecdoche because he knows my love for intense programming. 

My two favorite shows of all time are Six Feet Under, which I watched in its entirety as I learned to program last year. And The Wire, which I almost gave up on because I was bored stiff during the first episode. I stayed with it only because Madeleine Forbes and Ev were all, "give it a chance, man," and now I love it.

The other reason Ev suggested Synecdoche is since the start of the week I've given a lot of thought to genius grants. These things actually exist. They're called MacArthur Fellowships. It's all anonymous, which is also true for [Gittip](http://gittip.com), which I view as distributed, peer-to-peer genius grants. Lots of people supporting each other financially so they can work on and do what they love. Those who have more to give, contribute more. Those who are doing the work and need more support, get more.

In Synecdoche, the main character, Caden Cotard (played by Philip Seymour Hoffman) is given one such genius grant (though in his case it's a lump-sum from higher up, rather than little bits from lots of people - his is vertical, rather than horizontal) about a quarter of the way through the film. He goes from getting by to having so much income he can do whatever he wants with his time and never thinks about earning again. 

He lets the part of his brain stamped EARN take a permanent vacation.

Sounds great! But when you think about it, especially if you've watched The Wire, you know what I mean when I say The Hustle gives you Purpose. It does. The drive to get some product out the door gives you laser-like focus, and without the boundaries of 'you're running out of cashmoney', you've got to get that pushback from _somewhere_.

Caden Cotard is tragic - not semi-tragic, not kinda pathetic melancholy in an Eternal Sunshine kinda way. No, I find him flat-out tragic. This play he's making, funded by the genius grant, goes on for most of eternity, and I don't want to spoil the plot, but there's really no saving graces to this guy. I keep wanting for there to be. But with unlimited funding, it's like he has a permanent case of The Resistance.

If you read my work during 2011 and 2012, you know I got obsessed with The Resistance. After I read _The War of Art_ I started seeing The Resistance everywhere, in everybody, including myself. I couldn't not see it. I was grateful Steven Pressfield had written, finally, the truth about getting things into the world. He covered, in a slim volume, basically every kind of cop out, every excuse I had for not doing the work. Once I got to the end I was all, 'huh. I've done every single one of these things. Now that I know about the Resistance, I'll aim to never have it again!' 

That has almost but not quite worked out. 

Anyway, Caden has The Resistance (which, by the way, is contagious), but there's something more pernicious at play. He spends the duration of the film trying to get buy-in. From anybody. His wife, his second wife, his daughter, the people in the play he's staging. He wants them to say you're an alright kinda guy Caden. You're doing your best. And even when they _do_ say that, he never takes it to heart. He keeps berating himself, wishing he could get _total buy-in_ from _the whole world_. Failing that, he keeps plugging on this play, trying to get _it_ perfect. (Trying to get it perfect is a symptom of the Resistance. You have to hit publish, even if you think it's shit, which you always a little bit will. Think it's shit, that is.)

The only person who can give you total buy-in on your life is you.

There's also no pleasure to this guy's life. He's so caught up in his own _dukkha_ which means dissatisfaction in Buddhist, that he can't see straight. Sure, he fucks but it's always sad. You know, like he's hoping he could perform a little better. He's weepy and self-absorbed. (Contrast that with self-contained.) 

He never merges with his lover. He holds her at arm's length, wanting, you guessed it. 

Total buy-in.

The only person who will give you total buy-in is you. That's why when someone says to me, 'Oh, I could never write like you do. My life's not that interesting,' I take them at their word. 

I see they haven't bought into their own story.

This isn't to say you don't have to drop the story-_line_. My work isn't just in telling masturbatory stories I like to write that you'll like to read. It's also unplugging for two years to listen to my own voice. To discover whether what I'm telling you is true is true for me, or is it just what you (they, the group/collective) want to hear.

Returning after two years away, I'm clearer now on my voice than I was when I left. And. It turns out, the voice isn't that much different. That's one thing I've enjoyed about being back on Twitter this week. Oh! Here I am. And I'm not a whole lot different than when I blank-slated.

Which. Is why I blank the slate. What remains after you blank the slate is as close to true as you're going to get. And you're never going to get to total blank. 

You will never come out clean.

That is what I love about Six Feet Under. None of those characters come out clean, and still, I forgive each one. I forgive them their foibles and 'shortcomings'. 

I forgive the parts of them I thought I couldn't forgive in myself.

They remind me I can let myself off the hook. Caden never lets himself off the hook. He never builds his pleasure palette. He never takes stock of what brings him geniune pleasure.

And I wonder if that's because _he never bottoms out_. I've bottomed out so many times now. I chuckle when I think about them. I don't think my mini-tragedies are actually all that tragic. Yes, of course, hard at the time. Yes, if you're going through hell keep going. But maybe it was during these past two years during a self-chosen exile that showed me: it could always be worse. And it has made pleasure _that much easier_ to touch, each moment.

I didn't always say that. I used to say, "this is the worst thing of all time!" High drama. I'd fling myself on the couch and have a cry for the afternoon.

But when I turn anything on its head and say, "it could always be worse," and "what's the worst that could happen here?" I see the situation differently. That difference, though slim, hasn't just once saved my life. It keeps saving my life.

Whether you think mine is a life worth living means not a whit to me. 

Because the person who has to demonstrate total buy-in is me.

And I do.

###An Engineer Like You

Last week I called my grandfather, whom I call Bub. I called Bub to remind him of when I was little and I'd beg to go with him to the hospital. Bub worked shift work his whole life, and most of the time I knew him growing up, he did the shift work in a hospital. 

We're both engineers, though he did his work AFK. He never used a computer for work, but he did have a man cave he'd go into when he got to the hospital to start his shift, and that was one of the things I liked best about it. That there was this secret place in this ginormous hospital where he, and sometimes I, could go hide out. 

The engineering break room was long and narrow with a bed in the back against the wall. There was a pinup calendar with voluptuous women in tiny outfits in front of motorcycles. The room smelled of tools, of grease and of men, since those were the only things in there most of the time.

I actually hated hospitals is the thing. I didn't want to be in the hospital itself, because it was the same place my mom spent a lot of her five years dying.

Anyway, engineering. Bub's shift. The thing is. When I called him to remind him of how I loved going into work with him, he didn't start reflecting back what I was expecting to hear. He said

_Honey, you remember when you wanted to take a shower out there after the hurricane?_

_No, what do you mean take a shower? At the hospital?_

_Mmhmm, right. I took you in there in the Renault and you remember that curve at the KOA, a tree came right in through the windshield. Whole tree branch._

_OhmygodBub. I could have died!_

_Sure right you could have. Nearly got your face, I... (he trails) You don't remember that?_

_Well, huh. Yeah, no. I guess I don't._

_Well, we turned back and got a different car. And then I got that generator so you could take showers. Yup, sure did._

<hr /> 

Sometimes I don't get out of him what I went into the call for, but I get something that jump starts another line of thinking. Which of course is ok with me. Bub's in his seventies now, which you'd think would dull him. But the opposite has happened. He remembers a whole set of data that I have altogether forgotten. He has an engineering mind, he sees systems I don't.

Looking at the hospital as an engineer isn't the same as being a patient there. I didn't feel scared when I hung with Bub. Even when very little, when I felt lonely or sad or tired I'd grab a hand, and his hands were usually a little greasy, and always warm. And I knew I could trust him as we navigated the labyrinthine hospital up to the roof. Where we'd check in on the fans. And then down to the generator room, which was still running during the hurricane, hence the shower I was able to take.

The generators can't go down at a hospital. That's the mission critical room. Generators make it so any terrible thing can happen and those patients on respirators, those patients who are in compromised situations, they still get the support they need.

<hr />

As I've become an engineer myself, I experience the joy and challenge of being relied upon. Not relied upon as in if this goes down, people will die. I'm not that kind of engineer. But when I see an ECONNREFUSED I know there are people on the other side of their machines getting something other than they expect. I go into the generator room that is my virtual private server, and I start -ef'ing around, killing and restarting processes.

And, I go into diagnosis mode. If I can't right the ship immediately, I step away from the machine and reapproach again, once I've thought about it.

Becoming an engineer has slowed me down. I think in a different way now. 

I like to imagine I think more like Bub.

<hr />

Before we hung up the call I said

_Hey Bub, listen. I don't think I've ever really told you this, but I respect the work you've done. Thank you for showing me how I could become an engineer like you._

_Mmhmm, well, alright honey. Call your grandmother, she's over at Et's._
