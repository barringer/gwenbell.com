People ask me: how do you balance programming, writing and staying healthy? How do you balance being on the web for hours at a time with being well?

I can't respond to the word 'balance' because I'm not sure such a state exists. Nor am I sure that's a state I want to be in. I don't aim for balance. I aim to practice, stay in the present moment and take care of my own needs before anyone else's. I treat my life as the one precious opportunity it is.

Now, all that is preamble. I do love a little preamble. Gets your synapses firing.

Here are my daily wellbeing practices.

+ Astral plank. Now, I hear this has some fancy word for it, but I call it astral planking. I lay down, sleep or hit a sort of trance-like state where I go visit the faeries and or any other being living or dead that decides to stop by. Frequent visitors: faeries, Tilda Swinton. Once, Lester Freeman visited. Sometimes my mom stops by. If I can't go to sleep right away I listen to 87.5. That's static. Or I listen to simplynoise.com. But I try to fall asleep straight with no noise.

+ I start the day in the bath. I take a long, super long bath. I lay in there and breathe and think very little. I just feel and rest. I relax and take it easy. It's sacred time. If anything, I'll bring my laptop in and play Sigur Ros or Radiohead. But normally, I just take it slow and silent.

+ I practice yoga. Whether I down dog it up or I forward fold it down. When I have near zero energy, I put my legs up the wall and just hang out there until my heart rate comes down.

+ I drink tea. Daily tea, green usually. I also drink a lot of espresso out of tiny sake cups. 

+ I write. I don't miss a day of writing. 

+ I write on paper. I use my Sakura pen to get things down. Little snatches of conversation. An idea on the way to the train. Anything.

+ I light candles. End of the day, I unwind with candlelight.

+ I have a daily appreciation habit. I say three appreciations each night, no matter how low my energy or how hard the day, I say three things from the day that I appreciate about my partner, each night before sleep.

+ I work. I work seven days a week. It doesn't matter what the weather is. Or how I feel. Or whether something strange is going on outside. I work every single day. Not because I have to. Because I want to.

+ I 'git push origin master' and commit every day.

+ I bless my food before eating. I picked this up in Japan: _itadakimasu_. I put my hands in prayer position and bless my food, the people who grew it, prepared it and whatever had to give its life for me to continue mine.

+ I walk. Every day I walk between 5,000 and 10,000 steps. Sometimes I walk to Manhattan from Brooklyn if I'm feeling real fierce.

+ I eat whatever I want. I didn't eat meat for years, but starting in Berlin in summer 2012, I eat meat again for the first time in more than a decade. I eat it in moderation because I know I'm privileged to be able to eat the flesh of beings who gave their lives for me. I have been 130-135 pounds since I graduated high school. I eat what I want, when I want, in a fashion similar to my grandmother, Nunu, with whom I grew up from eleven on. She was/is hypoglycemic. I learned from her to eat small meals, frequently, snacking on small things (for me that's apples, bananas and lately, daifuku) occasionally and eating until not-full, rather than full.

+ I spend my time with people who inspire me by doing the work. Even when that means I'm spending time with people no longer on the planet. I have a group of people I call upon during mastermind sessions. Some of them are still alive, others aren't. It's how I roll.

+ I say no more often than I say yes. I practice putting up boundaries around my time, energy and life force. Why? Because I know I have one life. And I take that fact seriously.

+ Speaking of, sometimes I archive everything in my inbox without responding. Just because someone asks a question doesn't mean I'm required to answer it. On my death certificate there won't be a checkbox for 'died with inbox zero'.

+ Once a week I call my grandparents, listen to their stories, ask them questions to fill in blanks in my own understanding of myself, and before I hang up I tell them I love them.

+ I have strategy sessions. I check in every six hours or so to see where things are and how to tighten the ship up. If needed, I do a PPPH (Personal Productivity Power Hour) and blast through some stuff. 

+ I write down priorities if I'm feeling lost and needing clarity. This is less necessary to me now than it once was. I feel scattered less frequently than I did before taking two years off the public web.

+ I reflect on my own behavior during the day - I wonder how I can do better the next time around. I cut myself a lot of slack, while holding my feet to the fire.

+ I reflect on my own death daily.

+ I floss.

I'm sure I'll think of other things. I bet reading this list will give you an idea of how I operate, what I value and why. Maybe it'll help you as you reflect on your own one precious life.
