#### Gwen Bell, 2011 to 2012

While out for coffee with your buddy. You spend an inordinate amount of time texting in the restroom. You don't have to tell her what you were doing in there. She notices your lack of it.

When you meet a new person and spend 3/4 of the time fondling the phone in your pocket, he notices. Even if he doesn't say so, he notices your lack of it.

When you're at a bar with friends but what you really want to be doing is watching tv, at home, alone. They notice your lack of it.

When you're at your son's sporting event and spend it with your digital companion, those who share the event with you notice your lack of it.

What's lacking is your presence.

It is not what we say, nor what we create, nor how we delete that matters. Although, yes, they precede and follow us. It is our presence. That is something we can only offer while we're alive. We can only offer our presence _once_. In the moment we are in. Post-death, we offer stand-ins for our presence - book titles, movie credits, bylines, grave markers, holographic representations if we're hot shit enough. 

<mark>Your presence? It is irreplicable.</mark> 

Everything I've written points to how to cultivate this presence. I can't reach through the screen and be present with you as you read this, but the people in my life who experience my presence reflect this back to me: my presence stays with them after I leave the room.

I practice cultivating presence. I don't think it's something any of us can buy, though we can buy access to guides to help us practice, to help us deepen into ourselves, so we don't have to check out when we're with other people.

I sold my iPhone in the Mission in 2012, and before that I took attention detoxes, digital sabbaticals, _sesshin_ in Japan, thousands of hours on my own yoga mat and hundreds with my hands on the bodies of the students in my yoga studio in Japan. That is the writer whose words you read as you read this work. 

I come at you as someone with the experience of an intermediate practitioner, a technologist unwilling to permanently leave the machine because I know the power in it. And also, the wits and guts to know this machine is not the boss of me. 

The moment you know that, <mark>the moment you can walk into the bathroom, use the toilet, flush, wash your hands and leave without playing a quick game on your phone.</mark> The moment you can say no, I won't eat that, to a television commercial. The moment your attention becomes so pure you don't ask for permission to leave a conversation that drains rather than energizes you. 

In that moment you will no longer need my work. I hope that on that day, you walk away. By the time you get there, you will know how.

###Presence includes: Digital Warriorship (version 1 and version 2), Reverb and the Attention Detox.

#### Digital Warriorship | Technical Skill Level: Beginner | PDF

To be present for others, first see and hear yourself. 

Align your real self with your digital self. My path from scrolling for empathy to taking digital sabbaticals and what I learned. Here's an introduction to start developing your presence.

#### Attention Detox | Technical Skill Level: Beginner | PDF

An Attention Detox helps you keep track of your attention for 168 hours. It's guaranteed to bring into focus how distracted you are, and what you need to do reclaim your attention.

#### Reverb | Technical Skill Level: Beginner | PDF

Once you're aligned, your message can travel. These are the stories of how I did, and do, the work.

#### Digital Warriorship II | Technical Skill Level: Beginner | PDF

Experiments in paying better, closer attention.

When I check out, I check in with myself to course-correct. I determine the cause of the check out, and I spend time determining the best route to getting back in the flow. Sometimes, that means a year off the public web, as it did in 2012. During that time I wrote Digital Warriorship again, this time in Kyoto, Japan. 

As of 2013, I'm back on the public web. I bring the work I did then with me, and I will tell you this, my work is in a more powerful place than it has ever been. I know this is a blessing.

May _Presence_ help you as you learn to cultivate yours.

When you buy, you get all of this as a single package.

<hr />

In Japan, whether or not someone does business with you is based on the first impression they get. They do a presence check.

When I started giving public talks in 2008, I asked rooms full of tech-savvy listeners to power down their iPhones, or at least put them away.

In yoga class this week in New York, the teacher instructed his students: take your phones off your mats, put them in your bags, unless you can justify them to me.

Nobody even _attempted_ to justify their phone. But. Why don't we make that same choice daily? What's with that tiny box?

In _Presence_ I take you through everything: _Digital Warriorship_, when I still struggled with digital distraction. To the second version, which takes you a step further into your own attention detox and digital sabbatical. You'll learn ways to choose where you place your attention and how to make healthier choices. _Reverb_ shows you what to do with that presence now that you've cultivated it. _Reverb_ helps you get how to be in alignment with your message so you can share it. So your message _travels_ without you.

Money. Can't take that with you when you die.

Presence? Can't give _that_ from the grave.
