Gwen Bell tells it to you straight, whether you're learning how to make your product Reverb through the social web, or learning to align yourself around your digital life in Digital Warriorship.

### Reverb 

#### By Gwen Bell | March 2012, San Francisco + Singapore

Everything Gwen Bell ever learned about marketing, told to you in stories from her real life. You'll learn the secret marketing strategy she used to guarantee success while opening her yoga studio in japan (hint: it involved standing outside a cafe handing out pamphlets).

### Digital Warriorship II

#### By Gwen Bell | June 2012, Japan

What's the difference between Digital Warriorship I and II? One year, and three months of experiences. The first was very poetic. It was Gwen Bell's first ebook, and it was very buddhisty. This Digital Warriorship is more experiment-driven.

***

All of these ebooks have been rewritten at least twice. Because that's how Gwen Bell does it. She writes her books twice.
