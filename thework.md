The Work
=========

###2010-2012 Offerings

From 2011 to 2012 I traveled the world, writing to inboxes. These are the covers of some of the paid offerings from 2011 to 2012. If you'd like to purchase anything other than Digital Warriorship or Git Commit, [please be in touch](mailto:gwen@gwenbell.com). If you'd like to hear from readers on their experience of the work, read their responses.

I call it The Work in the vein of Steven Pressfield, who taught me how to face the Resistance and create better work than I did the day before, every day. I owe a debt of gratitude to him for _The War of Art_.
