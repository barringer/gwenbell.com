####What is presence? What difference does it make?

You go out for coffee. You spend an inordinate amount of time texting in the restroom. You don't have to tell her what you were doing in there when you return. She notices your lack of it. What's lacking is your presence.

It is not what we say. It's not what we create. Although, yes our words and creations precede and follow us. It is _our presence_ that matters. Our presence is something we can only offer while we're alive. 

We can only offer our presence _once_. In the moment we are in. Post-death, we offer stand-ins for our presence - book titles, movie credits, bylines, grave markers, holographic representations. 

Your presence? It is irreplicable.

For the first time, I'm offering a curated collection of the work I created from 2011 to 2012. This is _Presence_.

#### Digital Warriorship | Technical Skill Level: Beginner | PDF

To be present for others, first see and hear yourself. 

Align your real self with your digital self. My path from scrolling for empathy to taking digital sabbaticals and what I learned. Here's an introduction to start developing your presence.

#### Attention Detox | Technical Skill Level: Beginner | PDF

An Attention Detox helps you keep track of your attention for 168 hours. It's guaranteed to bring into focus how distracted you are, and what you need to do reclaim your attention.

#### Reverb | Technical Skill Level: Beginner | PDF

It’s a reverberation when the desire to see it chart its own path becomes greater than the urge to control it. (I think that’s also a definition of love.)

Once you're aligned, your message can travel. These are the stories of how I did, and do, the work.

#### Digital Warriorship II | Technical Skill Level: Beginner | PDF

Experiments in paying better, closer attention.

When I check out, I check in with myself to course-correct. I determine the cause of the check out, and I spend time determining the best route to getting back in the flow. Sometimes, that means a year off the public web, as it did in 2012. During that time I wrote Digital Warriorship again, this time in Kyoto, Japan. 

As of 2013, I'm back on the public web. I bring the work I did then with me, and I will tell you this, my work is in a more powerful place than it has ever been. I know this is a blessing.

May _Presence_ help you as you learn to cultivate yours.

_Presence_ includes a PDF of Digital Warriorship I, Digital Warriorship II, Reverb and the Attention Detox, for $97.

In Japan, whether or not someone does business with you is based on their first impression. They do a presence check.

In yoga class this week in New York, the teacher instructed his students: take your phones off your mats, put them in your bags, unless you can justify them to me. Nobody even _attempted_ to justify their phone. If we can't justify it, why don't we make that same choice daily?

In _Presence_ you travel through everything: _Digital Warriorship_, when I still struggled with digital distraction. To the second version, which takes you a step further into your own attention detox and digital sabbatical. You'll learn ways to choose where you place your attention and how to make healthier choices. _Reverb_ shows you what to do with that presence now that you've cultivated it. _Reverb_ helps you get how to be in alignment with your message so you can share it. So your message _travels_ without you.

Money. Can't take that with you when you die.

Presence? Can't give _that_ from the grave.
