Belongings
==========

I've lived with little for years, inspired by the only book on simplicity I recommend, Duane Elgin's [Voluntary Simplicity](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Voluntary-Simplicity-Duane-Elgin/dp/0688121195). 

I read Elgin's book with my legs up the wall in a tiny dorm room at the University of East Anglia, in Norwich, England. I'm always surprised when I meet someone who even knows where that is, let alone has been there. 

I already lived with few belongings, though I now reflect on myself back then and am _shocked_ at how much I traveled with. Once I read Voluntary Simplicity I had more reasons to continue on the path.

During the nearly four years I lived in Japan I learned to appreciate the _chibi kawaii_, small and cute, way of living. I believe a few small, but beautifully crafted, items can last a lifetime.

About this list
---------------

I'm not compensated when you buy things on the list. For now, my brand reppin' for cash days are over. If that changes, I'll let you know in an explicit way.

I do not own a storage unit. This list is it.

Hardware
--------

Everything I own fits in this [Mission Workshop](http://missionworkshop.com/products/advanced_projects/vx-rucksack.php) bag. Nope, I don't rent a storage unit anywhere. Bonus. If you're in SF talk with Morgan. Tell him Gwen says hey and I actually did the RTW thing out of the bag he sold me.

[Outlier](http://outlier.cc/). US-based company making the best pants I've ever owned. Abe, the CEO, actually responded personally when I pitched him on a crazy idea from Singapore. In March 2013, I went to his offices to thank him in person upon arriving in Brooklyn.

[Eloquent JavaScript](http://eloquentjavascript.net/) The one book I own a physical copy of at the moment. Beautiful book, beautifully written and bound.

[Leica D-Lux 5](http://en.leica-camera.com/photography/compact_cameras/d-lux_5/) I bought this Leica in 2011 and have enjoyed it nearly every day since. Perfectly crafted, the photos it produces are a reflection of the care that went into creating this camera.

[iPod Nano Watch](http://www.engadget.com/2010/12/29/hex-ships-ipod-nano-watch-band-dares-you-to-destroy-it-video/) I don't own a phone. I sold my iPhone in the Mission in SF in January 2012. I don't miss owning a phone. I think humans will look back on the scrolling days as a time of deep addiction and distraction; having been there - addicted to and distracted by my iPhone from 2007 to 2010 myself, I speak from experience. 

When Patrick offered me his Nano watch while I was in Japan in July 2012, I said yes. Because I want to know the time, and I want to jam out to the beats. So, this little watch means a lot to me.

[MacBook Air](https://www.apple.com/macbookair/) Been around the globe with me. I put Linux on it for six months, and am now back to the OSX (though I'm ready to get back to Linux - I'd miss my photo editing tools). I program on it, and I write on it, and I live with this machine.

[Notebook](http://www.fabrianoboutique.com/products_det.asp/Prodotto/ECOQUA+A4+%28SADDLE+STITCH%29)

[Pen Sakura Micron 02 Black](http://www.sakuraofamerica.com/Pen-Archival)

Clothes. I have a couple of outfits I wear on repeat. By couple, I mean three. I wear mostly black. I don't list every article of clothing because I find it boring to update when something wears out. That said, I wear Ibex underwear (the boy shorts) and have for years now. Wool underwear, another life changer. Who knew.

Shoes. Right now I own one pair of shoes. Black Chucks, high top. I've worn Vibrams, but I looked like such a freak I couldn't get down the street without someone asking what was on my feet. I do too much work to be having that conversation all the time. I am open to ideas on the shoe front - you find some good ones - black or dark grey - hollah.

Wetware
-------

I don't skimp on my body. I get my teeth checked every 6 to 8 months, I lengthen my spine on planes and I do yoga daily. On this:

[Manduka](http://www.manduka.com/us/shop/categories/products/mats/eko-superlite-travel-mat/) I have it in black. Though I love it, this is not for beginner practitioners. If you're a beginner, try [this one](http://www.gaiam.com/yoga-mats/premium-sticky-yoga-mat/95-0726,default,pd.html?start=4&cgid=3010400) from Gaiam - it's what I started on.

[Neti pot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neti_pot). Life changer. I no longer take any allergy medication. Zero.

Bronners. I use it for everything - body, house cleaning, clothes cleaning. I'd drink it in a pinch. Though, that's [not recommended](http://brokelyn.com/tested-the-crazy-alleged-uses-of-dr-bronners-soap/) by Brokelyn.

[Kimono](http://www.kimono-condoms.com/) Bill Gates is [requesting help](http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2013/mar/24/bill-gates-offers-100000-grant-improved-condoms/print/) from entrepreneurs to help make a better condom. I bet that'll take a little time. In the meantime, you'd do well to switch to Kimonos. The blue box.-

Glasses. I have an astigmatism and am near sighted. I've worn some sort of sight extender since third grade. I gave up on contacts in 2012 and now wear glasses. Or, I walk around blindish with my glasses hanging off my jacket. I've though about Lasik but value my sight too much to put it in any jeopary, even a tiny tiny tiny bit of jeopary is too much risk to me.

Sonicare toothbrush. Invest in your teeth and gums, you don't want to have to replace them.
