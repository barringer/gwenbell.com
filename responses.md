Today I erased it all and started again. Deleted the whole caboodle, actually, thanks to Gwen Bell who somehow encouraged me to the very edge of the safe rubber dinghy that is blogging on a platform like Wordpress.

"I can't do it!" I said. "It's frightening! I'm a writer, a thinker, not some kind of tech-y code-y person who builds websites! All the Internet People will sense that and find out and judge me and be angry and throw bitcoins at me!"

[...]

"It's just you and me now, website" I said to my website on this sunny Cambridge afternoon, in the quiet of the library, watching the shadows from the history faculty lengthen towards the lawn.</p>

You see, I'm going to learn to swim.

Hi Gwen,

Receiving another email from you felt as refreshing as your peppermint tea probably did. I already have a 9 to 5 job as a social worker with a commonwealth welfare agency in Australia. But sometime last year after something you said 'clicked', I explored ways to 'sell my art' (that is, being a social worker, working with people, assessing families and situations, and writing formal reports) differently, and taking a deep breath and getting myself out there.

I've been following your work for a while now. You inspired me with Reverb. You encouraged me to read A Guide to the Good Life: The Ancient Art of Stoic Art – then I passed it along to both of my siblings, one of which is my business partner and the other a sideshow performer in Coney. You've pushed me to wrap my head around Bitcoin, economics and now stretch out of my comfort zone into open-source development. But more than anything, you've inspired me to continue to challenge my attachments and "the way things are done" – both personally and professionally.
