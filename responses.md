Hi Gwen,

Receiving another email from you felt as refreshing as your peppermint tea probably did. I already have a 9 to 5 job as a social worker with a commonwealth welfare agency in Australia. But sometime last year after something you said 'clicked', I explored ways to 'sell my art' (that is, being a social worker, working with people, assessing families and situations, and writing formal reports) differently, and taking a deep breath and getting myself out there.

I've been following your work for a while now. You inspired me with Reverb. You encouraged me to read A Guide to the Good Life: The Ancient Art of Stoic Art – then I passed it along to both of my siblings, one of which is my business partner and the other a sideshow performer in Coney. You've pushed me to wrap my head around Bitcoin, economics and now stretch out of my comfort zone into open-source development. But more than anything, you've inspired me to continue to challenge my attachments and "the way things are done" – both personally and professionally.
