Today I erased it all and started again. Deleted the whole caboodle, actually, thanks to Gwen Bell who somehow encouraged me to the very edge of the safe rubber dinghy that is blogging on a platform like Wordpress.

"I can't do it!" I said. "It's frightening! I'm a writer, a thinker, not some kind of tech-y code-y person who builds websites! All the Internet People will sense that and find out and judge me and be angry and throw bitcoins at me!"

[...]

"It's just you and me now, website" I said to my website on this sunny Cambridge afternoon, in the quiet of the library, watching the shadows from the history faculty lengthen towards the lawn.</p>

You see, I'm going to learn to swim.

Hi Gwen,

Receiving another email from you felt as refreshing as your peppermint tea probably did. I already have a 9 to 5 job as a social worker with a commonwealth welfare agency in Australia. But sometime last year after something you said 'clicked', I explored ways to 'sell my art' (that is, being a social worker, working with people, assessing families and situations, and writing formal reports) differently, and taking a deep breath and getting myself out there.

I've been following your work for a while now. You inspired me with Reverb. You encouraged me to read A Guide to the Good Life: The Ancient Art of Stoic Art – then I passed it along to both of my siblings, one of which is my business partner and the other a sideshow performer in Coney. You've pushed me to wrap my head around Bitcoin, economics and now stretch out of my comfort zone into open-source development. But more than anything, you've inspired me to continue to challenge my attachments and "the way things are done" – both personally and professionally.

Hello Gwen...Your work inspires me to be present, in the same way The Invitation touched me when I first read it...except that you create something new every day for me to consider...thank you...

First let me say, I am a fan of your writing. I stumbled upon your
blog while reading someone else's a couple of years ago. It was an
interview that you did. In it, you responded to the question about
what you believed when you were younger that you don't believe now.
Your reply was, "love is finite".

So it wasn't your wisdom regarding the social web that caught my
attention, rather it was your beliefs and values (and great writing).
I was (and still am) moved by posts that apply both yoga and Buddhism
to your work, life and those that challenge your readers to do the
same. I used the prompts from Reverb2010 as tools to write about
coming to terms with my father's death last October.

Gwen is an inspiration as she encourages us to become better at business, communication and self-expression.  (Gwen is also the brains behind this “Best of 2009” blogging project.  I’m just following her lead…)

Hello Gwen,

I'm amazed at how small and interconnected the world really is.  Today I received a facebook message from a friend on the other side of the country who didn't know that I had started a blog.  It turns out that she follows yours faithfully, and while clicking through links on Monday's post, she found mine!

I'm honoured again for you to use my words.  It gives me confidence to keep trying to write.

I know that this blog challenge must be a nightmare to manage, and you are pouring so much energy into commenting and encouraging others.

I just wanted you to know how much I appreciate what you are doing.

Thanks so much,

Rachel Bearse

I’ve followed Gwen since she started podcasting with the Buddhist Geeks and I was thrilled to see a girl share her experiences of modern Buddhism, although many times I felt she had taken some unnecessary criticism for voicing her views. I’m most impressed with Gwen’s absolute honesty and willingness to share. She is empowering others and doing so not out of a full on wish for ego or power, but rather to make this place a better one and helping people to connect. Gwen lives fully, whether it is in joy, sadness or a bit in between.

Gwen. How I love watching you grow and blossom!

On Startup Yoga (2007) That's so damn cool! I bet none of those geeks (and I mean it in the best possible way) expected they'd be doing hourly yoga. You're a awesome addition to the startupweekend phenomena.
 
I somehow suspect that video of you all doing yoga with your laptops will get some publicity... :)
